## Integrity in Practice

- Acting with integrity means aligning actions with personal principles.
- Consistency is key; moral standards should not change based on situation or parties involved.
- Dilemmas arise when personal morals conflict with professional ethics or legal requirements.

**Example Dilemmas:**
- Lawyers defending guilty clients due to professional ethics.
- Doctors restricted by medical ethics from euthanasia, despite personal beliefs.

---

## Key Questions for Consideration

1. What is ethics?
2. What trends have increased the likelihood of unethical behavior?
3. What is corporate social responsibility, and why is fostering good business ethics important?
4. What measures can organizations take to improve their business ethics?
5. How can you include ethical considerations in your decision making?
6. What trends have increased the risk that information technology will be used in an unethical manner?

## Critical Thinking Exercise

**Legal vs. Ethical Actions:**  
Consider examples for each quadrant (see table above) and reflect on situations where legality and morality may conflict.

# Ethics in Business World

Ethics has risen to the top of the business agenda because the risks associated with inappropriate behavior have increased, both in their likelihood and in their potential negative impact. We have seen the collapse and/or bailout of financial institutions such as Bank of America, Citigroup, Countrywide Financial, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers, and American International Group (AIG) due to unwise and/or unethical decision-making regarding the approval of mortgages, loans, and lines of credit to unqualified individuals and organizations.

We have also witnessed numerous corporate officers and senior managers sentenced to prison terms for their unethical behavior, including former investment broker Bernard Madoff, who bilked his clients out of an estimated $65B, and Stewart Parnell, former CEO of Peanut Corporation of America, who was sentenced to 28 years in prison for knowingly shipping contaminated food products, resulting in a salmonella outbreak that killed nine people and sickened more than 700.

Clearly, unethical behavior in the business world can lead to serious negative consequences for both organizations and individuals.

Several trends have increased the likelihood of unethical behavior. First, for many organizations, greater globalization has created a much more complex work environment that spans diverse cultures and societies, making it more difficult to apply principles and codes of ethics consistently. Numerous U.S. companies have moved operations to developing countries, where employees or contractors work in conditions that would not be acceptable in the most developed parts of the world. For example, it was reported in 2016 that the employees of the Pegatron factory in China, where the Apple iPhone is produced, are often forced to work excessive amounts of overtime—up to 90 overtime hours per month—while their overall wages have been cut from $1.85 to $1.60 per hour.

Second, in today's challenging and uncertain economic climate, many organizations are finding it more difficult to maintain revenue and profits. Some organizations are sorely tempted to resort to unethical behavior to maintain profits. Tesco, Britain’s largest supermarket chain, admitted its first half-year profits for 2013 were overstated by $400M. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles admitted its U.S. auto sales were overstated by hundreds of cars each month starting as far back as 2011.

Employees, shareholders, and regulatory agencies are increasingly sensitive to violations of accounting standards, failures to disclose substantial changes in business conditions, nonconformance with required health and safety practices, and the production of unsafe or substandard products. Such heightened vigilance raises the risk of criminal and civil lawsuits resulting in fines and/or incarceration for individuals.

A classic example of the many risks associated with unethical decision-making can be found in the Enron accounting scandal in 2000. Enron, a Texas-based energy company, employed over 22,000 people and reported annual revenue of $101 billion. However, in 2001 it was revealed that much of Enron's revenue was the result of deals with limited partnerships, which it controlled. In addition, as a result of actions taken contrary to generally accepted accounting practices (GAAP), many of Enron's debts and losses were not reported in its financial statements. As the accounting scandal unfolded, Enron's shares dropped from $90 per share to less than $1 per share, and the company was forced to file for bankruptcy. The Enron case was notorious, but many other corporate scandals have occurred in spite of safeguards enacted as a result of the Enron debacle. Here are just a few examples of lapses in business ethics by employees in IT organizations:

## Examples of Corporate Misconduct

- **Volkswagen**: Has admitted that 11M of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. The company is now contending with the fallout.
- **Toshiba**: The Japanese industrial giant, whose diversified products and services include information technology and communications equipment and systems, disclosed that it overstated its earnings over a seven-year period by more than $1.2B.
- **Amazon**: Has the second-highest employee turnover rate of companies in the Fortune 500 and has been criticized by some for creating a high-pressure work environment in which bosses’ expectations were almost impossible to satisfy, and jobs were threatened if illness or other personal issues encroached on work.

It is not unusual for powerful, highly successful individuals to fail to act in morally appropriate ways, as these examples illustrate. Such people are often aggressive in striving for what they want and are used to having privileged access to information, people, and other resources. Furthermore, their success often inflates their belief that they have the ability and the right to manipulate the outcome of any situation. The moral corruption of people in power, which is often facilitated by a tendency for people to look the other way when their leaders act inappropriately, has been given the name:

### Bathsheba Syndrome

A reference to the biblical story of King David who became corrupted by his power and success. According to the story, David became obsessed with Bathsheba, the wife of one of his generals, and eventually ordered her husband on a mission of certain death so that he could marry Bathsheba.

Even lower-level employees and ordinary individuals can find themselves in the middle of ethical dilemmas, as these examples illustrate:

- **Edward Snowden**: Working as a Dell contractor at the National Security Agency (NSA), he copied thousands of classified and unclassified documents that revealed details about the capabilities and scope of operations of the NSA and other foreign intelligence agencies. The documents were then handed over to reporters who published many of the disclosures in the Guardian and Washington Post newspapers. Snowden felt he acted as a patriot in exposing the behavior of the NSA, which he thought was overreaching and counter to the U.S. Constitution. Some consider him a whistleblower and a hero, while others see him as a traitor.
- **Mark Lillie**: A former Takata Corporation engineer warned the company of the potential deadly consequences of using the propellant ammonium nitrate to inflate its airbags. The use of ammonium nitrate enabled Takata to earn a greater profit than other designs; however, it also resulted in devices that could deploy with too much force, causing them to rupture and shoot metal fragments at motorists. Unfortunately, Lillie was unable to convince management at Takata to choose an alternative design. He eventually left the firm in disagreement over this fatal manufacturing decision. In the United States, at least 10 deaths and more than 100 injuries have been attributed to the flawed devices, and over 100M cars with Takata inflators have been recalled worldwide.

### Ethical Dilemma Scenario
You are a new hire at a large software firm and have been working overtime for the last two months trying to complete the final testing of a new software release for the firm’s flagship product, which is used by thousands of organizations worldwide. Unfortunately, the software has many bugs and testing has taken weeks longer than expected. This afternoon your boss stopped by and asked you to “sign off” on the completion of your portion of the testing. He explains that the project has gone over budget and is in danger of missing the committed release date for customers. When you object because you feel the software is still buggy, he says not to worry—whatever bugs remain will be fixed in the next release of the

### Answer to Ethical Dilemma Scenario

I would refuse to sign off on the software release in its current state. The software contains multiple vulnerabilities that could expose **customer Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**, **Sensitive Information (SII)**, confidential company data, and potentially compromise the backend database.  

I would explain to my manager that releasing the software as-is would be unethical and could lead to serious harm for both customers and the company. Instead, I would recommend **requesting additional time** or **prioritizing the resolution of critical issues** before the release.  

As a professional, I **cannot ethically approve or support shipping an unfinished and buggy product**, regardless of the deadline pressure or budget concerns.

# Ethics of Computing and Technology  
*Engaging Through Science Fiction*  
*The MIT Press, 2023*

---

## 1. Ethical Statements: Normative vs. Descriptive

Ethics is often misunderstood as being only **normative**—focused on what should be. In reality, even simple factual descriptions often embed subtle value judgments.

- **Normative Statements**: Assess how things *should* be.
  - Examples:
      - “He was wrong to do that.”
      - “Being kind is more important than being the most successful.”
  - Rooted in judgments about good/bad, permissible/forbidden, and the relative value of things.

- **Descriptive Statements**: Assess how things *are*.
  - Example:
      - A newspaper’s choice of “suspect,” “loiterer,” “passerby,” “boy,” or “juvenile” to describe a person arrested near a crime scene.  
        Each term meets factual criteria but communicates different normative judgments, shaping public perception.

**Key Point:** Every act of description involves choices, often unconsciously, that communicate values.

---

## 2. Ethics and Computing: The Invisibility Factor

James Moor identified the "invisibility factor" as a unique ethical challenge in computing:

1. **Invisible Abuse**: Exploitation through hidden or lower-level computer operations (e.g., silent manipulation during financial transactions).
2. **Invisible Programming Values**: Algorithms make decisions that advantage or disadvantage people in ways users cannot see.
3. **Invisible Calculations**: Computers perform complex calculations beyond human inspection or understanding.

**Reflection:**  
Always ask, “What is invisible in this technology? What values are embedded in the unseen?”

---

## 3. Technology’s Impact on Society (Deborah Johnson)

Deborah Johnson (1998) highlights three major societal changes due to computing technologies:

### a) Reproducibility
- Rapid, mass reproduction and transmission of information (texts, images, videos).
- Easier collection, linking, and preservation of records.
- Significant implications for privacy and record-keeping.

### b) Information Flow
- Shift from one-to-one and one-to-many communication to many-to-many (e.g., social media).
- Changes how knowledge is shared and accessed.

### c) Identity Conditions
- Increased connectivity and computation enhance both tracking and anonymity.
- Technology enables anonymous communication and action, but also facilitates pervasive surveillance.

---

## 4. Science Fiction: A Tool for Ethical Engagement

Science fiction immerses us in alternative sociotechnical worlds, helping us consider how societies and individuals adapt to and are shaped by new technologies.

**Application:**  
Analyze sci-fi scenarios to anticipate real-world ethical challenges.

---

## 5. Ethical Frameworks (Chapter 2, Page 45+)

### Learning Objectives
- Understand why multiple ethical frameworks exist.
- Identify and describe the key frameworks: **deontology**, **utilitarianism**, **virtue ethics**, and **communitarianism**.
- Contrast the traditions and applications of each framework.
- Critique classical frameworks using contemporary approaches (e.g., responsibility ethics, feminist ethics, capabilities approach).
- Formulate and analyze ethical tensions within stories and cases.

---

### Overview of Ethical Frameworks

#### **Deontology**
- **Focus:** Duties, rights, and moral obligations.
- **Principle:** Rightness/wrongness is determined by adherence to rules, not outcomes.
- **Divine Command Theory:** Morality based on obedience to God’s commands (Euthyphro problem: Are things good because God commands them, or does God command them because they are good?).

#### **Virtue Ethics**
- **Focus:** Human flourishing and character.
- **Principle:** Virtues are means between extremes (Aristotle’s "golden mean").
- **Examples:**  
    | Virtue      | Excess            | Deficiency             |
    |-------------|-------------------|------------------------|
    | Courage     | Recklessness      | Cowardice              |
    | Friendliness| Flattery/Fawning  | Hostility/Crankiness   |
    | Temperance  | Overindulgence    | Insensitivity          |
    | Generosity  | Wastefulness      | Stinginess             |
  - The suitable degree of virtue varies by situation and is guided by practical wisdom.

#### **Communitarianism**
- **Focus:** Interdependence, common good, self-realization within community.
- **Principle:** Social, spiritual, and psychological goods arise from relationships; isolation hinders self-realization.

#### **Utilitarianism**
- **Focus:** Happiness and outcomes.
- **Principle:** The greatest happiness for the greatest number; actions are judged by their overall effects.

---

## 6. Modalities for Judgment

- Ethical frameworks serve as lenses, not explicit formulas.
- Multiple frameworks may reach similar conclusions by different reasoning.
- Strong frameworks remain flexible for diverse contexts and challenges.

---

## 7. Key Takeaways

- Technology ethics requires consideration of both visible and invisible impacts.
- Ethical reasoning is a process—contextual, comparative, and often quantitative.
- Applied ethics asks: “How does this affect real people, now and in the future?”

---

## 8. Critical Questions for Practice

1. What invisible values or biases are embedded in the algorithms you use?
2. How does reproducibility challenge traditional privacy?
3. How do tech communities promote or hinder self-realization and collective well-being?
4. How can happiness or harm from technology be measured, and who decides the metrics?
5. Where do your own value judgments influence your technology assessments?
