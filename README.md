## Integrity in Practice

- Acting with integrity means aligning actions with personal principles.
- Consistency is key; moral standards should not change based on situation or parties involved.
- Dilemmas arise when personal morals conflict with professional ethics or legal requirements.

**Example Dilemmas:**
- Lawyers defending guilty clients due to professional ethics.
- Doctors restricted by medical ethics from euthanasia, despite personal beliefs.

---

## Key Questions for Consideration

1. What is ethics?
2. What trends have increased the likelihood of unethical behavior?
3. What is corporate social responsibility, and why is fostering good business ethics important?
4. What measures can organizations take to improve their business ethics?
5. How can you include ethical considerations in your decision making?
6. What trends have increased the risk that information technology will be used in an unethical manner?

# Ethics in Business World

Ethics has risen to the top of the business agenda because the risks associated with inappropriate behavior have increased, both in their likelihood and in their potential negative impact. We have seen the collapse and/or bailout of financial institutions such as Bank of America, Citigroup, Countrywide Financial, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers, and American International Group (AIG) due to unwise and/or unethical decision-making regarding the approval of mortgages, loans, and lines of credit to unqualified individuals and organizations.

We have also witnessed numerous corporate officers and senior managers sentenced to prison terms for their unethical behavior, including former investment broker Bernard Madoff, who bilked his clients out of an estimated $65B, and Stewart Parnell, former CEO of Peanut Corporation of America, who was sentenced to 28 years in prison for knowingly shipping contaminated food products, resulting in a salmonella outbreak that killed nine people and sickened more than 700.

Clearly, unethical behavior in the business world can lead to serious negative consequences for both organizations and individuals.

Several trends have increased the likelihood of unethical behavior. First, for many organizations, greater globalization has created a much more complex work environment that spans diverse cultures and societies, making it more difficult to apply principles and codes of ethics consistently. Numerous U.S. companies have moved operations to developing countries, where employees or contractors work in conditions that would not be acceptable in the most developed parts of the world. For example, it was reported in 2016 that the employees of the Pegatron factory in China, where the Apple iPhone is produced, are often forced to work excessive amounts of overtime—up to 90 overtime hours per month—while their overall wages have been cut from $1.85 to $1.60 per hour.

Second, in today's challenging and uncertain economic climate, many organizations are finding it more difficult to maintain revenue and profits. Some organizations are sorely tempted to resort to unethical behavior to maintain profits. Tesco, Britain’s largest supermarket chain, admitted its first half-year profits for 2013 were overstated by $400M. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles admitted its U.S. auto sales were overstated by hundreds of cars each month starting as far back as 2011.

Employees, shareholders, and regulatory agencies are increasingly sensitive to violations of accounting standards, failures to disclose substantial changes in business conditions, nonconformance with required health and safety practices, and the production of unsafe or substandard products. Such heightened vigilance raises the risk of criminal and civil lawsuits resulting in fines and/or incarceration for individuals.

A classic example of the many risks associated with unethical decision-making can be found in the Enron accounting scandal in 2000. Enron, a Texas-based energy company, employed over 22,000 people and reported annual revenue of $101 billion. However, in 2001 it was revealed that much of Enron's revenue was the result of deals with limited partnerships, which it controlled. In addition, as a result of actions taken contrary to generally accepted accounting practices (GAAP), many of Enron's debts and losses were not reported in its financial statements. As the accounting scandal unfolded, Enron's shares dropped from $90 per share to less than $1 per share, and the company was forced to file for bankruptcy. The Enron case was notorious, but many other corporate scandals have occurred in spite of safeguards enacted as a result of the Enron debacle. Here are just a few examples of lapses in business ethics by employees in IT organizations:

## Examples of Corporate Misconduct

- **Volkswagen**: Has admitted that 11M of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. The company is now contending with the fallout.
- **Toshiba**: The Japanese industrial giant, whose diversified products and services include information technology and communications equipment and systems, disclosed that it overstated its earnings over a seven-year period by more than $1.2B.
- **Amazon**: Has the second-highest employee turnover rate of companies in the Fortune 500 and has been criticized by some for creating a high-pressure work environment in which bosses’ expectations were almost impossible to satisfy, and jobs were threatened if illness or other personal issues encroached on work.

It is not unusual for powerful, highly successful individuals to fail to act in morally appropriate ways, as these examples illustrate. Such people are often aggressive in striving for what they want and are used to having privileged access to information, people, and other resources. Furthermore, their success often inflates their belief that they have the ability and the right to manipulate the outcome of any situation. The moral corruption of people in power, which is often facilitated by a tendency for people to look the other way when their leaders act inappropriately, has been given the name:

### Bathsheba Syndrome

A reference to the biblical story of King David who became corrupted by his power and success. According to the story, David became obsessed with Bathsheba, the wife of one of his generals, and eventually ordered her husband on a mission of certain death so that he could marry Bathsheba.

Even lower-level employees and ordinary individuals can find themselves in the middle of ethical dilemmas, as these examples illustrate:

- **Edward Snowden**: Working as a Dell contractor at the National Security Agency (NSA), he copied thousands of classified and unclassified documents that revealed details about the capabilities and scope of operations of the NSA and other foreign intelligence agencies. The documents were then handed over to reporters who published many of the disclosures in the Guardian and Washington Post newspapers. Snowden felt he acted as a patriot in exposing the behavior of the NSA, which he thought was overreaching and counter to the U.S. Constitution. Some consider him a whistleblower and a hero, while others see him as a traitor.
- **Mark Lillie**: A former Takata Corporation engineer warned the company of the potential deadly consequences of using the propellant ammonium nitrate to inflate its airbags. The use of ammonium nitrate enabled Takata to earn a greater profit than other designs; however, it also resulted in devices that could deploy with too much force, causing them to rupture and shoot metal fragments at motorists. Unfortunately, Lillie was unable to convince management at Takata to choose an alternative design. He eventually left the firm in disagreement over this fatal manufacturing decision. In the United States, at least 10 deaths and more than 100 injuries have been attributed to the flawed devices, and over 100M cars with Takata inflators have been recalled worldwide.

### Ethical Dilemma Scenario
You are a new hire at a large software firm and have been working overtime for the last two months trying to complete the final testing of a new software release for the firm’s flagship product, which is used by thousands of organizations worldwide. Unfortunately, the software has many bugs and testing has taken weeks longer than expected. This afternoon your boss stopped by and asked you to “sign off” on the completion of your portion of the testing. He explains that the project has gone over budget and is in danger of missing the committed release date for customers. When you object because you feel the software is still buggy, he says not to worry—whatever bugs remain will be fixed in the next release of the

### Answer to Ethical Dilemma Scenario

I would refuse to sign off on the software release in its current state. The software contains multiple vulnerabilities that could expose **customer Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**, **Sensitive Information (SII)**, confidential company data, and potentially compromise the backend database.  

I would explain to my manager that releasing the software as-is would be unethical and could lead to serious harm for both customers and the company. Instead, I would recommend **requesting additional time** or **prioritizing the resolution of critical issues** before the release.  

As a professional, I **cannot ethically approve or support shipping an unfinished and buggy product**, regardless of the deadline pressure or budget concerns.

<h1>Corporate Social Responsibility</h1>
<p>corporate social responsibility (CSR) is the concept that an organization should act ethically by taking responsibility for the impact of its actions on its shareholders, consumers, employees, community, environment, and suppliers An organization’s approach to CSR can encompass a wide variety of tactics—from donating a portion of net profit to charity to implementing more sustainable business operations or encouraging employee education through tuition reimbursement. Setting CSR goals encourages an organization to achieve higher moral and ethical standards. </p>

<h3>An Organization’s Program CSR Affects Its Shareholders, Consumers, Employees, Community, Environment, and Suppliers </h3>

<img width="562" height="534" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/986e4a98-aa10-494d-b0fc-2fe4be847b0c" />

<p>An illustration shows the various sectors of an organization affected by CSR. The center circle labeled “Corporate Social Responsibilty” points to six surrounding circles with the following labels: Shareholders, Consumers, Employees, Community, Environement, and Suppliers. </p>

<p>supply chain sustainability is a component of CSR that focuses on developing and maintaining a supply chain that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. Supply chain sustainability takes into account issues such as fair labor practices, energy and resource conservation, human rights, and community responsibility. Many IT equipment manufacturers have made supply chain sustainability a priority, in part, because they must adhere to various European Union directives and regulations—including the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive, the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, and the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Regulation—to be permitted to sell their products in the European Union countries. In many cases, meeting supply chain sustainability goals can also lead to lower costs. For example, in fiscal year 2015, Dell launched its closed-loop plastics supply chain and by year end had recycled 2.2 million pounds of those plastics back into new Dell products. In addition, its global takeback program has made Dell the world’s largest technology recycler, collecting more than 1.4 billion pounds of e-waste since 2007.</p>

### [CITE]
>  http://i.dell.com/sites/doccontent/corporate/corp-comm/en/Documents/fy15-cr-report.pdf 

<p>Each organization must decide if CSR is a priority and, if so, what its specific CSR goals are. The pursuit of some CSR goals can lead to increased profits, making it easy for senior company management and stakeholders to support the organization’s goals in this arena. However, if striving to meet a specific CSR goal leads to a decrease in profits, senior management may be challenged to modify or drop that CSR goal entirely. For example, most U.S. auto manufacturers have introduced models that run on clean, renewable electric power as part of a corporate responsibility goal of helping to end U.S. dependence on oil. However, Americans have been slow to embrace electric cars, and many manufacturers have had to offer low-interest financing, cash discounts, sales bonuses, and subsidized leases to get the autos off the sales floor. Manufacturers and dealers are struggling to increase profits on the sale of these electric cars, and senior management at the automakers must consider how long they can continue with their current strategies. </p>

<p>Many organizations define a wide range of corporate responsibility areas that are important to them, their customers, and their community. In order for a CSR program to be effective, a senior executive should be placed in charge of corporate responsibility results for each area, with strategic initiatives defined, staffed, and well-funded. Key indicators of progress in these areas should be defined and the results tracked and reported to measure progress. </p>

# Why Fostering Corporate Social Responsibility and Good Business Ethics Is Important?

Organizations have at least five good reasons to pursue CSR goals and to promote a work environment in which employees are encouraged to act ethically when making business decisions:

- Gaining the goodwill of the community
- Creating an organization that operates consistently
- Fostering good business practices
- Protecting the organization and its employees from legal action
- Avoiding unfavorable publicity

## Gaining the Goodwill of the Community

Although organizations exist primarily to earn profits or provide services to customers, they also have some fundamental responsibilities to society. As discussed in the previous section, companies often declare these responsibilities in specific CSR goals.

All successful organizations, including technology firms, recognize that they must attract and maintain loyal customers. **Philanthropy** is one way in which an organization can demonstrate its values in action and make a positive connection with its stakeholders.  
*(A stakeholder is someone who stands to gain or lose, depending on how a particular situation is resolved.)*

As a result, many organizations initiate or support socially responsible activities, which may include:  

- Making contributions to charitable organizations and nonprofit institutions  
- Providing benefits for employees in excess of any legal requirements  
- Devoting organizational resources to initiatives that are more socially desirable than profitable  

Here are a few examples of some of the CSR activities supported by major IT organizations:

- **Dell Inc.**: Has several initiatives aimed at reducing the amount of natural resources it takes to create and ship its products, cutting the amount of energy it takes its customers to use its products, and curbing the effects its products have on people and the planet.
### [CITE]

- **Google**: Agreed to invest more than $1.5 billion in renewable energy projects, such as large-scale wind farms and rooftop solar panels.
### [CITE]
> http://research-methodology.net/google-corporate-social-responsibility-csr/

- **IBM**: Created a program to train transitioning service members to become certified as advanced data analysts. The company also launched the P-TECH program to help students from low-income families finish high school and obtain associate degrees. Several graduates of the program have taken entry-level jobs at IBM while continuing to work toward a four-year degree.

- **Microsoft**: Made $922 million in technology donations to more than 120,000 nonprofit organizations globally, and its employees contributed $117 million to 20,000 nonprofits through the company’s corporate giving program.

- **Oracle**: Delivered nearly $5 billion in resources (with a focus on computer science education) to help 2.2 million students in 100 countries become college-and-career ready.

<p>The goodwill that CSR activities generate can make it easier for corporations to conduct their business. For example, a company known for treating its employees well will find it easier to compete for the top job candidates. On the other hand, businesses that are not socially responsible run the risk of alienating their customer base. A recent study of more than 10,000 shoppers in 10 different countries revealed that more than 90 percent are likely to switch to brands that support a socially responsible cause, given similar price and quality. In addition, 90 percent of the shoppers surveyed would boycott a company if they learned that the firm engaged in socially irresponsible business practices. Indeed, 55 percent of the respondents had already done so in the previous year.</p>

The goodwill that CSR activities generate can make it easier for corporations to conduct their business. For example, a company known for treating its employees well will find it easier to compete for the top job candidates.  

On the other hand, businesses that are not socially responsible run the risk of alienating their customer base. A recent study of more than 10,000 shoppers in 10 different countries revealed that:  

- More than **90%** are likely to switch to brands that support a socially responsible cause, given similar price and quality.  
- **90%** of the shoppers surveyed would boycott a company if they learned that the firm engaged in socially irresponsible business practices.  
- **55%** of the respondents had already done so in the previous year.

<h1>Fostering Good Business Practices</h1>
<p>In many cases, good ethics can mean good business and improved profits. Companies that produce safe and effective products avoid costly recalls and lawsuits. (The recall of the weight loss drug Fen-Phen cost its maker, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, almost $14 billion in awards to victims, many of whom developed serious health problems as a result of taking the drug. Companies that provide excellent service retain their customers instead of losing them to competitors. Companies that develop and maintain strong employee relations enjoy lower turnover rates and better employee morale. Suppliers and other business partners often place a priority on working with companies that operate in a fair and ethical manner. All these factors tend to increase revenue and profits while decreasing expenses. As a result, ethical companies tend to be more profitable over the long term than unethical companies.</p>

On the other hand, bad ethics can lead to bad business results. Bad ethics can have a negative impact on employees, many of whom may develop negative attitudes if they perceive a difference between their own values and those stated or implied by an organization’s actions. In such an environment, employees may suppress their tendency to act in a manner that seems ethical to them and instead act in a manner that will protect them against anticipated punishment. When such a discrepancy between employee and organizational ethics occurs, it destroys employee commitment to organizational goals and objectives, creates low morale, fosters poor performance, erodes employee involvement in organizational improvement initiatives, and builds indifference to the organization’s needs.

# Protecting the Organization and Its Employees from Legal Action

In a 1909 ruling (*United States v. New York Central & Hudson River Railroad Co.*), the U.S. Supreme Court established that an employer can be held responsible for the acts of its employees even if the employees act in a manner contrary to corporate policy and their employer’s directions.  
The principle established is called **respondeat superior**, or “let the master answer.”

When it was uncovered that employees of **Wells Fargo Bank** opened over **2 million bogus credit card accounts** not authorized by its customers, the bank was fined **over $185 million** and ordered to pay customers full restitution for any fees or charges they may have incurred.  
The practice began at least as early as 2011 and was an attempt by thousands of bank employees to achieve their sales targets for **cross-selling** and be rewarded with higher sales bonuses.  

> **Cross-selling** is the practice of selling multiple products to existing customers—savings account, checking account, auto loan, mortgage, credit card, etc. Cross-selling to existing customers is cheaper than locating and selling to brand new customers. It also tends to lock existing customers into your bank.

A coalition of several legal organizations, including:  
- Association of Corporate Counsel  
- U.S. Chamber of Commerce  
- National Association of Manufacturers  
- National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers  
- New York State Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers  

argues that organizations should “be able to escape criminal liability if they have acted as responsible corporate citizens, making strong efforts to prevent and detect misconduct in the workplace.”

One way to do this is to establish effective **ethics and compliance programs**. However, some people argue that officers of companies should not be given light sentences if their ethics programs fail to deter criminal activity within their firms.  

I believe the **government should also enforce and support these programs** because it makes the process more transparent and helps people in need.

# How Organizations Can Improve Their Ethics

Research by the **Ethics Resource Center (ERC)** found that **86%** of the employees in companies with a well-implemented ethics and compliance program are likely to perceive a strong ethical culture within the company, while **less than 25%** of employees in companies with little to no program are likely to perceive a culture that promotes integrity in the workplace.  

A well-implemented ethics and compliance program and a strong ethical culture can, in turn:  
- Reduce pressure on employees to misbehave  
- Decrease observed misconduct  
- Create an environment where employees are more comfortable reporting instances of misconduct  

This is partly because there is **less fear of potential retaliation** by management against reporters (e.g., reduced hours, transfers to less desirable jobs, and delays in promotions).  
See **Figure 1-5**.

## Characteristics of a Successful Ethics Program
The Ethics Resource Center has defined the following characteristics of a successful ethics program:
- Employees are willing to seek advice about ethics-related issues.
- Employees feel prepared to handle situations that could lead to misconduct.
- Employees are rewarded for ethical behavior.
- The organization does not reward success obtained through questionable means.
- Employees feel positively about their company.

## 🏢 Conclusion
The risk of unethical behavior is increasing, making it crucial for companies to **improve business ethics**.  
The following sections explain specific actions corporations can take to strengthen workplace ethics.


# Appoint a Corporate Ethics Officer

A **corporate ethics officer** (also called a **corporate compliance officer**) provides an organization with vision and leadership in the area of business conduct. This individual “aligns the practices of a workplace with the stated ethics and beliefs of that workplace, holding people accountable to ethical standards.”*

Organizations send a clear message to employees about the importance of ethics and compliance in their decision about **who will be in charge of the effort** and **to whom that individual will report**.  
Ideally, the corporate ethics officer should be a **well-respected, senior-level manager** who reports directly to the **CEO**. Ethics officers come from diverse backgrounds, such as:  
- Legal staff  
- Human resources  
- Finance  
- Auditing  
- Security  
- Line operations  

---

## History of Ethics Officer Appointments
A rapid increase in the appointment of corporate ethics officers typically follows the revelation of a major business scandal:  
1. **Late 1980s:** First wave of appointments after defense-contracting scandals during Ronald Reagan’s administration, where firms used bribes to gain insider information for contract bids.  
2. **Early 1990s:** Another spike followed federal sentencing guidelines that allowed **preferential treatment during prosecutions for white-collar crimes** for companies with effective compliance and ethics programs.  
3. **Early 2000s:** A surge occurred after major accounting scandals.  
4. **Post-2008:** Yet another increase followed the mortgage loan scandals.

---

## Criticism of the Ethics Officer Role
The ethics officer position has critics:  
- **Concern:** Appointing one person might lead others in the organization to believe they have **no personal responsibility** for ethics.  
- **Counterpoint:** Odell Guyton, long-time director of compliance at Microsoft, argues:  
  > “A point person for ethics is necessary. Otherwise, how are you going to make sure it’s being done, when people have other core responsibilities? That doesn’t mean it’s on the shoulders of the compliance person alone.”  

---

## Key Responsibilities of a Corporate Ethics Officer
An ethics officer typically works to establish an environment that encourages ethical decision-making by:  
- **Ensuring compliance:** Implementing and maintaining ethical procedures across the organization.  
- **Creating and maintaining an ethics culture:** Aligning corporate behavior with the values set by top-level leadership.  
- **Serving as a key contact:** Acting as the main resource and authority for corporate ethics and principles.  

---

## Conclusion
Simply naming a corporate ethics officer does **not automatically improve an organization’s ethics**.  
Hard work, strong leadership, and ongoing support are required to establish and maintain a successful organizational ethics program.

# Establish a Corporate Code of Ethics

A **code of ethics** is a statement that highlights an organization’s key ethical issues and identifies the overarching values and principles that are important to the organization and its decision making.  

Codes of ethics frequently include formal, written statements about:  
- The **purpose** of an organization  
- Its **values**  
- The **principles** that should guide employee actions  

An organization’s code of ethics applies to its directors, officers, and employees, and it should:  
- Focus employees on areas of **ethical risk** related to their roles  
- Provide **guidance** to help them recognize and deal with ethical issues  
- Offer **mechanisms for reporting unethical conduct**  
- Foster a **culture of honesty and accountability** within the organization  

An effective code of ethics helps ensure that employees abide by the law, follow necessary regulations, and behave in an ethical manner.

---

## Implementation of a Code of Ethics
A code of ethics cannot gain company-wide acceptance unless:  
- It is developed with **employee participation**  
- It is **fully endorsed** by the organization’s leadership  
- It is easily accessible to **employees, shareholders, business partners, and the public**  

The code of ethics must:  
- Be **applied continually** in company decision making  
- Be **emphasized as part of company culture**  
- Enforce consequences for breaches, ensuring its relevance is not undermined

---

## Corporate Responsibility Rankings
Each year, **Corporate Responsibility magazine** rates publicly held U.S. companies based on ethical performance in categories such as:  
- Environment  
- Climate change  
- Human rights  
- Employee relations  
- Corporate governance  
- Philanthropy and community support  
- Financial performance  

**Intel Corporation**, the world’s largest chipmaker, has ranked in the **top 25 every year** since the list began in 2000 and was ranked **second in 2016**, making it one of the most ethical companies in the IT industry.

---

## Intel’s Code of Conduct
Intel’s Code of Conduct (see Figure 1-6) applies to:  
- All Intel employees  
- Intel’s subsidiaries  
- Non-employee members of the Board of Directors regarding their Intel-related activities  
- Independent contractors, consultants, suppliers, and others doing business with Intel  

Each employee is responsible for:  
- Reading, understanding, and following the Code  
- Accepting that violations may result in **disciplinary action**, up to and including termination  
- Recognizing that legal violations may result in **civil or criminal penalties**

---

## Figure 1-6: Intel Code of Conduct Principles
Intel’s Code of Conduct affirms five core principles:

1. **Conduct business with honesty and integrity.**  
2. **Follow the letter and spirit of the law.**  
3. **Treat each other fairly.**  
4. **Act in the best interests of Intel and avoid conflicts of interest.**  
5. **Protect the company’s assets and reputation.**

# Conduct Social Audits

An increasing number of organizations conduct regular **social audits** of their policies and practices.  

In a social audit, an organization:  
- Reviews how well it is meeting its **ethical and social responsibility goals**  
- Communicates its **new goals** for the upcoming year  

This information is shared with:  
- Employees  
- Shareholders  
- Investors  
- Market analysts  
- Customers  
- Suppliers  
- Government agencies  
- The communities in which the organization operates  

---

## Example: Dell’s Social Audits  
As part of an ongoing effort to engrain socially responsible business behavior into all activities, key **Dell suppliers** undergo:  
- Quarterly reviews of their **social and environmental progress**  
- Assessments including:  
  - Audit performance data  
  - Policy compliance evaluation  
  - Specific implementation plans for suppliers’ own programs in compliance and environmental stewardship  

# Require Employees to Take Ethics Training

The ancient Greek philosophers believed that personal convictions about right and wrong behavior could be improved through education. Today, most psychologists agree with them.  

Lawrence Kohlberg, the late Harvard psychologist, found that many factors stimulate a person’s moral development, but one of the most crucial is **education**. Other researchers have repeatedly supported the idea that people can continue their moral development through further education, such as working through case studies and examining contemporary issues.

---

## Promoting the Code of Ethics Through Training
An organization’s code of ethics must be **promoted and continually communicated** within the organization, from the top to the bottom.  

Organizations can do this by:  
- Showing employees examples of how to apply the code of ethics in real life  
- Implementing comprehensive **ethics education programs** that encourage responsible and ethical behavior  

Such programs are often:  
- Presented in small workshop formats  
- Based on applying the organization’s code of ethics to **hypothetical but realistic case studies**  
- Including examples of recent company decisions guided by the code of ethics  

---

## Goals of Ethics Training
A critical goal of ethics training is to increase the percentage of employees who **report incidents of misconduct**.  

Employees must be:  
- Shown effective ways to report misconduct  
- Reassured that reports will be acted upon  
- Guaranteed protection from retaliation  

---

## Ethics Training in Practice
In its 2013 National Business Ethics Survey, the **Ethics Resource Center** reported that **81%** of surveyed organizations provide ethics training.*  

### Example: IBM
- IBM employees worldwide take part in an online **Business Conduct Guidelines** course and certification, available in over two dozen languages.  
- The training presents real-world scenarios employees may face in business.  
- Senior IBM leaders sponsor **integrity summits** emphasizing leadership’s role in creating an ethical culture.  
- The summits help employees identify compliance risks and actions to mitigate them.  
- IBM also provides online ethics and integrity training to nearly 20,000 employees of IBM’s partners and suppliers globally.*

---

## Benefits of Formal Ethics Training
Formal ethics training:  
- Increases awareness of a company’s code of ethics and its application  
- Demonstrates the company’s intention to operate ethically  
- Can reduce the company’s liability in legal actions  

# Include Ethical Criteria in Employee Appraisals

Managers play a key role in helping employees meet performance expectations by monitoring behavior and providing feedback.  

Increasingly, managers are **including ethical conduct as part of employee performance appraisals**.  

Criteria related to ethical conduct often include:  
- Treating others **fairly and with respect**  
- Operating effectively in a **multicultural environment**  
- Accepting **personal accountability** for meeting business needs  
- Continually **developing others and themselves**  
- Operating **openly and honestly** with suppliers, customers, and coworkers  

These ethical factors are considered alongside traditional appraisal criteria such as:  
- Overall contribution to advancing the business  
- Successful completion of projects and tasks  
- Maintenance of good customer relations  

---

## Survey Insight
A recent survey found that about **two-thirds of organizations** include ethical conduct as a performance measure in employee evaluations.*

# Create an Ethical Work Environment

Most employees want to perform their jobs successfully and ethically, but even good employees sometimes make bad ethical choices.  

Employees in highly competitive workplaces often feel pressure from:  
- Aggressive competitors  
- Cutthroat suppliers  
- Unrealistic budgets  
- Unforgiving quotas  
- Tight deadlines  
- Bonus incentives  

In such environments, employees may be encouraged to do “whatever it takes” to get the job done. Without a corporate code of ethics or strong senior management examples, some may feel pressured to engage in unethical conduct to meet expectations.

---

## The Boss’s Influence

The most important influence on how employees act is their perception of their **immediate boss’s expectations**.  

- If the boss clearly expects that **compliance failures and ethical lapses will not be tolerated**, employees are less likely to fail.

---

## Examples of Managerial Behavior That Encourage Unethical Conduct

- A manager sets and holds people accountable to meet “stretch” goals, quotas, and budgets, causing employees to think:  
  *“My boss wants results, not excuses, so I have to cut corners to meet the goals.”*

- A manager fails to provide a corporate code of ethics and operating principles, leading employees to think:  
  *“Because the company has no guidelines, I don’t think my conduct is really wrong or illegal.”*

- A manager sets a poor ethical example, causing employees to think:  
  *“I’ve seen successful people take unethical actions without negative repercussions.”*

- Managers fail to hold people accountable for unethical actions, so employees think:  
  *“No one will know the difference, and if they do, so what?”*

- Managers overwhelm new employees with thick policy binders and tell them to read and sign them when they have time. Employees think:  
  *“This is overwhelming. Can’t they just give me the essentials?”*

# Including Ethical Considerations in Decision Making

We are all faced with difficult decisions in our work and in our personal life. Most of us have developed a decision-making process that we execute automatically, without thinking about the steps we go through. For many of us, the process generally follows the steps outlined in **Figure 1-7**.

---

## Figure 1-7: A Five-Step Ethical Decision-Making Process

A stairway representation illustrates the following five steps in an ethical decision-making process:

1. **Develop Problem Statement**  
   - Don’t make assumptions.  
   - Verify “facts.”  

2. **Identify Alternatives**  
   - Enlist help of others.  

3. **Choose Alternative**  
   - Defensible and consistent.  
   - Consider impact on others.  

4. **Implement Decision**  
   - Create a transition plan.  

5. **Evaluate Results**  
   - Poor alternative?  
   - Bad implementation?  

---

The following sections discuss this decision-making process further and point out where and how **ethical considerations** need to be brought into the process.

# Including Ethical Considerations in Decision Making

We are all faced with difficult decisions in our work and in our personal life. Most of us have developed a decision-making process that we execute automatically, without thinking about the steps we go through. For many of us, the process generally follows the steps outlined in **Figure 1-7**.

---

## Develop Problem Statement

A **problem statement** is a clear, concise description of the issue that needs to be addressed.  
A good problem statement answers the following questions:  

- What do people observe that causes them to think there is a problem?  
- Who is directly affected by the problem?  
- Is anyone else affected?  
- How often does the problem occur?  
- What is the impact of the problem?  
- How serious is the problem?  

---

### Importance of a Problem Statement
Development of a problem statement is the **most critical step** in the decision-making process.  
Without a clear statement of the problem or the decision to be made, it is useless to proceed.  
If the problem is stated incorrectly, the chances of solving the real problem are greatly diminished.  

---

### Examples

- **Good Problem Statement:**  
  > Our product supply organization is continually running out of stock of finished products,  
  > creating an out-of-stock situation on over 15% of our customer orders,  
  > resulting in over **$300,000 in lost sales per month.**

- **Poor Problem Statement:**  
  > We need to implement a new inventory control system.  
  > *(This is a possible solution, not a problem statement. Pursuing this course of action will surely  
  > be expensive and time-consuming and may or may not solve the underlying problem.)*

- **Poor Problem Statement:**  
  > We need to install cameras and monitoring equipment to put an end to theft of finished product in the warehouse.  
  > *(Again, this is a possible solution, not a problem statement. And are there sufficient facts to support  
  > the hypothesis of theft in the warehouse?)*

---

### Key Considerations
You must gather and analyze **facts** to develop a good problem statement:  
- Seek information and opinions from a variety of people to broaden your frame of reference.  
- Avoid making assumptions about the situation.  
- Carefully check key facts for validity.  

> ⚠️ Simple situations can sometimes turn into complex controversies because no one takes the time to gather and analyze the real facts.

## Identify Alternatives

During this stage of decision making, it is ideal to **enlist the help of others**, including stakeholders, to identify several alternative solutions to the problem.  

- **Brainstorming with others** will increase your chances of:  
  - Identifying a broad range of alternatives.  
  - Determining the best solution.  

However, there may be times when it is inappropriate to involve others in solving a problem that you are **not at liberty to discuss**.  

---

### Providing Information
When sharing information about the problem with participants:  
- Offer **just the facts**, without your opinion.  
- Avoid influencing others to accept your preferred solution.  

---

### Brainstorming Guidelines
During any brainstorming process:  
- **Do NOT be critical** of ideas.  
  - Negative criticism will tend to shut down the discussion.  
  - The flow of ideas will dry up.  
- Simply write down the ideas as they are suggested.  
- Ask questions only to **gain a clearer understanding** of the proposed solution.  

## Choose Alternative

Once a set of alternatives has been identified, the group must **evaluate them based on numerous criteria**, such as:  

- **Effectiveness** in addressing the issue.  
- **Risks** associated with each alternative.  
- **Cost** to implement.  
- **Time** required for implementation.  

> ⚠️ An alternative that sounds attractive but is **not feasible** will not help solve the problem.

---

### Legal and Ethical Considerations
As part of the evaluation process, it is critical to weigh various laws, guidelines, and principles:  

- **Legal compliance:**  
  - Avoid violating any laws that may result in fines or imprisonment.  
- **Corporate policies:**  
  - Check if company guidelines apply.  
- **Code of ethics:**  
  - Review your organization's ethical standards.  
- **Personal morals:**  
  - Reflect on your own values.

---

### Evaluating Consequences
Consider the likely impact of each alternative from multiple perspectives:  
- On **you**.  
- On **your organization**.  
- On **other stakeholders** (including suppliers and customers).  
- On **the environment**.  

> Ask yourself: **Does this alternative do less harm than the other options?**

---

### Criteria for Selection
The selected alternative should:  
- Be **ethically and legally defensible** to coworkers, peers, and your profession’s governing body of ethics.  
- Be **consistent with organizational policies** and code of ethics.  
- Take into account the **impact on others**.  
- Provide a **practical and effective solution** to the problem.  

## Implement the Decision

Once an alternative is selected, it should be implemented in an **efficient, effective, and timely** manner.  

However, this is often easier said than done because people tend to **resist change**.  
> The bigger the change, the greater the resistance.

---

### The Role of Communication
Communication is the key to helping people accept change.  
A trusted and respected individual should address the following questions for stakeholders:  

1. **Why are we doing this?**  
2. **What is wrong with the current way we do things?**  
3. **What are the benefits of the new way for you?**

---

### Transition Plan
A **transition plan** must be defined to explain how people will move from the old way of doing things to the new way.  

Key points to ensure a smooth transition:  
- Make the transition appear **easy and pain-free**.  
- Provide **training** for affected individuals.  
- Offer **incentives** for successfully adapting to the change.  
- Modify the **reward system** to encourage behaviors that align with the change.  

## Evaluate the Results

After the solution to the problem has been implemented, **monitor the results** to determine:  
- If the desired effect was achieved.  
- The impact on the organization and various stakeholders.  
- Whether the success criteria were fully met.  
- If there were any unintended consequences.  

If necessary, further refinements may be required.  
> If so, return to **Step 1 (Develop Problem Statement)**, refine the problem as needed, and work through the process again.

---

### Poor Implementation vs. Poor Alternative
Sometimes, the proper alternative may have been selected, but it was implemented poorly.  
In this case:  
- Review and **redo certain implementation steps**.  
- Ensure proper communication, training, and transition support.

---

You are **shocked and alarmed**. You had no idea Elliot was unhappy, and your team desperately needs her to handle the onslaught of calls generated by the newest software release.  

If you're going to lose her, you'll need to find a replacement quickly.  

---

### Questions to Consider
- Should you **confront Elliot** and demand to know her intentions?  
- Should you **avoid confrontation** and simply begin seeking her replacement?  
- Is there **another appropriate action** you should take?  

> **Task:** Follow the **Five-Step Ethical Decision-Making Process** to decide what your next steps should be.

# Case Study: VW Cheats on Emissions Testing

Up until late 2015, Volkswagen AG (VW) was the second-largest carmaker in the world, with its 590,000 employees producing nearly 41,000 vehicles per day. At that time, the company’s prospects seemed bright, with many of its 12 subsidiaries (Audi, Bentley, Bugatti, Ducati, Lamborghini, etc.) performing well.

However, the company’s fortune changed drastically after it admitted in **September 2015** to installing software designed to **deceive emissions-testing procedures** in more than 11 million cars going back as far as 2005.

## Key Points:

- The **software** sensed when emissions tests were being conducted and **activated emission controls** to pass the tests. These controls were **deactivated during regular driving**, resulting in emissions that **exceeded legal limits**.
- The motive: better **torque, fuel efficiency**, and **performance**.
- VW's deception spanned **multiple diesel models** across VW, Audi, and Porsche.
- The **U.S. Department of Justice** sued VW in 2016; VW agreed to a **$14.7 billion settlement**—the largest in Clean Air Act history.
- Additional lawsuits and penalties followed, leading to:
  - A **24% drop in stock price**
  - VW **relinquishing its goal** of becoming the world’s top automaker by 2018

## Background and Corporate Culture:

- VW was founded in 1937 by the Nazi-controlled German Labour Front to build the “people’s car” (eventually the Beetle).
- Post-WWII, the British revived the company, which later became a symbol of West Germany’s economic recovery.

### Leadership Influence:

- **Ferdinand Piëch** (CEO 1993–2002): Aggressive, autocratic leader who demanded results at any cost.
- **Martin Winterkorn** (CEO 2007–2015): Shared a similar management style—berated employees, demanded impossible targets, and resisted environmental regulation.
- Both cultivated a **toxic culture of fear**, where employees were **afraid to speak up** or admit failure.

## Cultural Consequences:

- Critics claim the scandal was made possible by:
  - A **cutthroat culture**
  - Promotion-obsessed workaholics unwilling to challenge authority
  - **Normalization of deviance**—bad behavior becomes tolerated and normalized if it produces results

---

## 🚨 Critical Thinking Questions

### 1. Do you accept the explanation that “normalization of deviance” and a toxic culture explain the VW emissions scandal? Why or why not?

Consider:
- Leadership style
- Hiring practices
- Internal pressure to deliver impossible results
- Ethical expectations

---

### 2. VW must appoint a new CEO and key board member. Identify **three specific actions** their replacements must take to **change VW’s corporate culture**.

Consider:
- Internal reporting systems
- Whistleblower protection
- Transparency and ethical leadership training

---

### 3. Allegations suggest that **Robert Bosch GmbH** (supplier of VW’s engine control unit) may have aided in the emissions deception. Bosch claims they are not responsible for how VW integrated their components.

**Research Prompt:**  
What role did Bosch play in the scandal? Should Bosch be **sanctioned or fined**? Why or why not?

Consider:
- Supplier accountability
- Knowledge of misuse
- Legal and ethical implications

# Case Study: Toshiba Accounting Scandal

**Toshiba Corporation**, a Japanese electronics and engineering conglomerate headquartered in Tokyo, produces a wide range of products such as personal computers, semiconductors, consumer electronics, and nuclear power systems. It also provides services in information technology, communications, and nuclear reactor operations.

## Scandal Overview:

In **May 2015**, Toshiba formed an **outside panel** to investigate potential accounting irregularities—common in Japan due to the lack of independent directors on corporate boards. 

### Key Findings:

- CEO **Hisao Tanaka** resigned in **July 2015** when the panel discovered that Toshiba had **overstated profits by $1.2 billion** over 7 years (later revised to **$1.9 billion**).
- **Two former CEOs** and **six board members** also stepped down.
- A **culture of fear and obedience** pressured employees into improper accounting—postponing losses and moving costs into future years.
- The company set **unrealistic profit targets**, forcing units to exaggerate earnings.
- Toshiba **limited** the scope of the investigation, excluding key areas such as its U.S. nuclear business (**Westinghouse Electric Co.**), which later took a **$2.5 billion write-down**.

### Financial Fallout:

- Toshiba was **removed from the JPX Nikkei Index 400**, which tracks top-performing Japanese companies.
- First quarter losses post-scandal reached **$102 million**; stock hit a **36-year low** in early 2016.
- The company returned to profitability in Q2 2016, aided by **cost-cutting and layoffs**.

## Broader Context:

Japan has seen multiple corporate scandals—Livedoor, Olympus, Mitsubishi, and others. In response, under **Prime Minister Shinzo Abe**, efforts have been made to improve **corporate transparency** and attract **foreign investors**.

### Issues with Third-Party Panels:

- **Panels accept investigation scope set by the company**, limiting independence.
- **Panel members are not company directors**, and thus have **no fiduciary duty** to shareholders.
- Panels have **no legal power** to compel document production or testimony.

The Toshiba scandal was a blow to Japan's efforts to rebuild investor trust. Finance Minister **Taro Aso** called the scandal “woefully regrettable.”

---

## 🔍 Critical Thinking Questions

### 1. Should investigations continue until all parties involved in the Toshiba scandal are identified and punished?

- What are the **pros** (e.g., justice, deterrence)?
- What are the **cons** (e.g., costs, reputation damage, executive flight)?

---

### 2. Should Japan continue using outside panels for investigations?

- Do you see value in these **third-party reviews**, or can you propose a **better mechanism** to enforce transparency and compliance with laws and accounting standards?

---

### 3. Japan struggles with board independence and transparency compared to global standards.

- What **national-level reforms** or **corporate governance practices** would you suggest to improve **foreign investor confidence** and accountability?


<h1>Organizations Behaving Badly></h1>

<p>Queensland, the second largest state in Australia, awarded an outsourcing contract to IBM to build a new payroll application for its Department of Health at an initial cost estimate of $5 million. The project, however, went horribly wrong. Among other issues, the resulting system, delivered many months late, generated incorrect checks for some staff and no checks at all for others. As efforts mounted to fix the problems, the project cost ballooned out of control, eventually reaching more than $1 billion. Subsequent investigation by the state led to the allegations that IBM employees had acted unethically during the bidding process. In a report issued after the investigation, the Queensland government asserted that it would not have contracted with IBM were it not for misrepresentations made by IBM regarding its expertise as well as the true project costs. For its part, IBM claimed that Queensland employees did a terrible job in managing the project—a claim supported by the state’s own investigation.</p>

> As you read this chapter, consider the following questions:

> <p>1 What relationships must an IT worker manage, and what key ethical issues can arise in each?</p>
> <p>2 What can be done to encourage the professionalism of IT workers?</p>
> <p>3 What ethical issues do IT users face, and what can be done to encourage their ethical behavior?</p>

<h1>IT Worker Relationships That Must Be Managed</h1>

<p>IT workers typically become involved in many different work relationships, including those with employers, clients, suppliers, other professionals, IT users, and society at large. In each relationship, an ethical IT worker acts honestly and appropriately. These various relationships are discussed in the following sections. </p>

# IT Worker Ethics and Corporate Responsibility

## Employer-Employee Relationship in IT

- Some aspects of the relationship depend on circumstances (e.g., leaving early if time is made up later).
- Legal limits apply: employees cannot be forced to do illegal acts such as falsifying quality assurance results.
- Role-specific issues include:
  - Programming languages to be used
  - Documentation requirements
  - Testing extent

## Ethical Responsibilities of IT Workers

- IT workers are stewards of organizational IT resources.
- They must enforce ethical policies regarding IT use.
- IT professionals have skills that could enable system abuse.
- Software piracy is a significant temptation and legal issue:
  - Often blamed on end users but sometimes traced to IT staff allowing or engaging in piracy to reduce costs.

## Software Piracy and Industry Groups

- **Software & Information Industry Association (SIIA)** and **BSA | The Software Alliance** are major trade groups.
- SIIA:
  - Represents over 200 organizations (e.g., Google, Adobe, Bank of America).
  - Advocates legal environments protecting intellectual property.
- BSA:
  - Funded by member dues and settlements.
  - Includes Adobe, Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, and others.
  - Investigates piracy via hotlines, website tips, and referrals.
  - Reports often come from disgruntled or former employees, who may get monetary rewards.
  - In 2012, BSA investigated over 15,000 reports worldwide.

## BSA Enforcement Process

- Upon credible tip, BSA contacts the company for software inventories and license proof.
- If insufficient licenses:
  - Company must buy licenses and pay fines, or
  - Risk legal action, including search warrants with U.S. Marshall's office.
- Example: A Texas auto repair company faced multimillion-dollar fines, settled after legal counsel intervention.

## Trade Secrets and Confidentiality

- Trade secrets: valuable, confidential company information (e.g., software code, hardware design, business plans).
- Companies require employees to sign confidentiality agreements.
- Examples of famous trade secrets:
  - KFC’s 11 herbs and spices recipe
  - Coca-Cola formula
  - Intel’s manufacturing process

## Case Example: Zillow vs. Move

- Zillow provides online real estate data and valuation services.
- Move, a rival company, sued Zillow in 2014 alleging:
  - Theft of trade secrets by Zillow’s new executive (a former Move officer).
  - Copying thousands of documents and deleting texts/emails before resigning.
  - Attempted cover-up by Zillow.
- Settlement: Zillow paid $130 million without admitting liability.

## Whistle-Blowing in IT

- Whistle-blowing: reporting company misconduct threatening the public interest.
- IT workers may have special insight into dangerous or illegal practices.
- Internal reporting may be blocked or ignored.
- External reporting risks retaliation or firing.

## Case Example: Oracle Whistle-Blower Lawsuit

- Oracle competes in cloud services with Amazon, IBM, Microsoft, and SAP.
- Lawsuit by former employee alleges:
  - Management pressured her to inflate expected cloud revenues.
  - Oracle shares dropped 4% after the suit announcement.
- Oracle’s position:
  - Claims firing was due to poor performance.
  - Denies wrongdoing and plans countersuit.

---

*Note: This summary highlights ethical and legal challenges IT workers and companies face regarding software use, confidentiality, and corporate accountability.*


# Relationships Between IT Workers and Clients

IT workers provide services to clients; sometimes those “clients” are coworkers within the same company, other times they are from different companies. In these relationships:

- Each party agrees to provide something of value to the other.
- IT workers typically provide hardware, software, or services at a defined cost and timeline.
- Clients provide compensation, access to contacts, workspace, etc.
- These arrangements are usually formalized in contracts specifying:
  - Roles and responsibilities
  - Project start dates
  - Duration and cost

Despite differences in technical expertise, cooperation is essential for success.

---

## Decision Making and Trust

- Clients make project decisions based on information, alternatives, and recommendations from IT workers.
- Clients trust IT workers to act in their best interests.
- IT workers trust clients to provide:
  - Relevant information
  - Active listening
  - Understanding of the project impact
- Decision-making responsibility is shared between clients and IT workers.

---

## Potential Ethical Issues

### Conflict of Interest

- Occurs when IT consultants or auditors recommend their own or affiliated products/services to solve problems.
- Such behavior can undermine objectivity and trust.
- Example: A consulting firm rates an existing IT strategy poorly and insists on using its proprietary products.

### Incomplete or Misleading Reporting

- Project managers may lack information, tools, or experience for accurate project assessments.
- Pressure to keep resources flowing can lead to hiding problems.
- Contractual penalties may discourage honest status updates.
- This can result in clients being unaware of issues until crises emerge, leading to blame and legal disputes.

---

## Legal Concepts

### Fraud

Fraud is the crime of obtaining goods, services, or property through deception or trickery. To prove fraud in court, these elements must be shown:

1. False representation of a material fact by the wrongdoer.
2. Intent to deceive the innocent party.
3. Justifiable reliance by the innocent party on the misrepresentation.
4. Injury to the innocent party.

### Misrepresentation

- A misstatement or incomplete statement of a material fact.
- Can lead to contract cancellation or reimbursement if it induces a party to enter into a contract.

---

## Case Example: Affinity Gaming Data Breach

- Affinity Gaming, a Las Vegas casino company, suffered a 2013 data breach exposing customer credit card data.
- Hired **Trustwave** for investigation and containment.
- Trustwave claimed the breach was contained.
- A second breach occurred a year later.
- Affinity hired **Mandiant**, a competitor, who found Trustwave's investigation incomplete.
- Affinity sued Trustwave for misrepresentation regarding breach containment and remediation recommendations.

---

## Breach of Contract

- Occurs when one party fails to meet contractual terms.
- **Material breach**: Failure to perform obligations that impair or destroy the contract's essence.
- Remedies for non-breaching party:
  1. Rescind contract, seek restitution, and be discharged from further performance.
  2. Continue contract and sue for damages.

### Case Example: Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE) vs. Oracle

- Oracle stopped supporting Oracle database software on HPE’s Itanium-based systems.
- HPE argued this harmed sales of its products and benefitted Oracle’s own hardware.
- Court awarded HPE $3 billion for lost sales and damages.
- Oracle was required to continue supporting Itanium systems.

---

## IT Project Failures and Disputes

- Common issues leading to disputes:
  - Cost overruns
  - Schedule delays
  - Lack of required system functionality

- Disputes can involve claims of:
  - Fraud
  - Fraudulent misrepresentation
  - Breach of contract

- Most disputes settle out of court to avoid lengthy trials and bad publicity.
- IT vendors limit their legal exposure via contractual damage caps.

---

## Common Causes of IT Project Problems

- **Scope creep**: Changes in project scope or requirements causing overruns and missed deadlines.
- **Poor communication**: Misunderstandings between clients and vendors leading to unmet expectations.
- **Obsolete solutions**: Delivering systems that meet requirements but are outpaced by competitor offerings.
- **Legacy systems**: Hidden or undisclosed dependencies on old systems complicating integration and implementation.

# Relationships Between IT Workers and Suppliers

IT workers interact with many different hardware, software, and service providers. Building good relationships with suppliers encourages:

- Useful communication flow
- Sharing of innovative ideas
- Cost-effective use of products and services

## How IT Workers Can Build Good Supplier Relationships

- Deal fairly with suppliers.
- Avoid making unreasonable demands.  
  *Example:* Threatening to replace a supplier who cannot deliver equipment tomorrow when the normal lead time is one week is counterproductive.

## Ethical Concerns: Bribery

- Suppliers may attempt unethical actions, such as offering gifts intended as bribes.
- IT workers should **not** accept bribes.
- Examples of questionable gifts include expensive dinners or paid golf tournament fees, which may appear innocent but can be perceived as bribery by auditors.

---

## What is Bribery?

**Bribery** is providing money, property, or favors to someone in business or government to gain an unfair business advantage.

- A software sales rep offering money to a company employee to secure business is a classic example (kickback or payoff).
- Offering or accepting a bribe is a crime.
- Many states have bribery laws that can invalidate contracts involving bribes, though criminal convictions are rare.

---

## Case Example: Foxconn Technology

- Foxconn, the world’s largest electronics contract manufacturer, assembles products for companies like Apple, Nokia, and Sony.
- In 2014, five former employees (including two senior managers) were charged with bribery.
- The charges involved accepting kickbacks from 10 suppliers in exchange for purchasing contracts and clearing quality checks.
- Foxconn detected the issue via internal audit and alerted authorities in Taiwan and China.

---

## Internal Control

**Internal control** is a process set by an organization’s board, managers, and IT personnel to assure:

- Effectiveness and efficiency of operations
- Reliability of financial reporting
- Compliance with laws and regulations

### Components of Internal Control

- **People:** Employees responsible for following procedures and reporting issues.
- **Policies:** Guidelines and standards aligned with laws.
- **Processes:** Collections of tasks to achieve objectives.
- **Procedures:** Specific instructions for completing tasks.
- **Systems:** IT and operational systems enabling control.

### Roles in Internal Control

- **Management:** Ensures control systems are implemented and balanced against cost-benefit.
- **Employees:** Follow procedures and report inefficiencies.
- **Internal Audit:** Assesses implementation and effectiveness of controls, reports findings.

---

## Separation of Duties

- Critical concept in preventing fraud.
- Different individuals handle different parts of a financial process to prevent collusion.
- Example in accounts receivable:
  - Separate duties for receipt of payments, approving write-offs, depositing cash, and bank reconciliation.
- Lack of separation, common in small organizations, increases fraud risk.
- Monitoring by supervisors is a way to strengthen controls in small firms.

---

## Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)

- U.S. law making it illegal to bribe foreign officials.
- Applies to U.S. citizens, companies, and companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges.
- Payments lawful under local laws are exempt.
- Penalties:
  - Corporations: up to $2 million per violation.
  - Individuals: up to $100,000 fine and 5 years imprisonment.
- Requires companies to have adequate internal control systems and accurate books to prevent disguised bribes.
- Enforcement includes audits by internal and external auditors.

---

## Case Example: Hewlett-Packard (HP) FCPA Settlement

- HP paid $108 million to settle investigations by U.S. DOJ and SEC.
- Allegations involved subsidiaries bribing government officials in Mexico, Poland, and Russia.
- Misconduct included slush funds, two sets of books, anonymous emails, prepaid phones, and covert cash handovers.
- HP cooperated with the investigation; involved employees no longer employed.

---

## Gifts vs. Bribes

- In some countries, gift-giving is an essential business practice.
- In the U.S., gifts might be free tickets or promotional items from suppliers.
- **Key distinction:** Gifts must be declared and not hidden.
- Many companies require all gifts to be declared; token gifts may be accepted, but others often declined or pooled for charity.

### Table: Distinguishing Between Bribes and Gifts

| Bribes                                                    | Gifts                                              |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Made in secret; neither legally nor morally acceptable     | Made openly as a gesture of goodwill               |
| Often made indirectly through a third party                | Made directly from donor to recipient               |
| Create an obligation for the recipient to favor the donor  | No expectation of future favors for the donor       |

# Relationships Between IT Workers and Other Professionals

Professionals often feel a degree of loyalty to other members of their profession. As a result:

- They are often quick to help each other obtain new positions.
- They may be slow to criticize each other in public.
- They care about the reputation of their profession, since public perception affects individual members (e.g., teachers vs. politicians).

Professionals owe each other adherence to the **profession’s code of conduct**. Experienced professionals can also serve as **mentors** and help develop new members of the profession.

---

## Ethical Issues Among IT Professionals

### Résumé Inflation

- **Résumé inflation** is lying or exaggerating on a résumé.
- Common example: Claiming proficiency in a high-demand IT skill.
- Short-term benefit, but long-term harm to both individual and profession.
- Many employers view this as grounds for immediate dismissal.

#### Example:
Yahoo hired **Scott Thompson**, former PayPal executive, as CEO in 2012. He resigned within a year due to discrepancies in his academic qualifications.

### Inappropriate Sharing of Corporate Information

- IT workers may access private data on:
  - Employees
  - Customers
  - Suppliers
  - Budgets
  - New product plans
  - Promotions
- Sharing this data (whether sold or discussed casually) is unethical and often illegal.
- Could result in:
  - Termination
  - Criminal charges

#### Case Example: Ofcom Data Leak

- **Ofcom** (UK's telecom regulator) employed a short-term contractor.
- He offered his new employer (UKTV) **six years of confidential data** from competitors.
- Data included income and spending data from Ofcom’s market intelligence database.
- UKTV fired the employee and reported the incident.
- UKTV assured rivals that the data was deleted and not used.


# Relationships Between IT Workers and IT Users

The term **IT user** refers to a person who uses a hardware or software product. This term distinguishes **end users** from the **IT workers** who develop, install, service, and support the product. IT users rely on these products to:

- Deliver organizational benefits
- Increase their productivity

---

## Responsibilities of IT Workers

IT workers have several ethical and professional responsibilities toward users:

- **Understand users’ needs and capabilities**
  - Deliver products and services that best meet those needs
  - Work within **budget and time constraints**
  
- **Establish an ethical environment** that:
  - Discourages **software piracy**
  - Minimizes **inappropriate use of corporate computing resources**
  - Prevents **inappropriate sharing of information**

# Relationships Between IT Workers and Society

Regulatory laws establish safety standards for products and services to protect the public. However, these laws are less than perfect and cannot safeguard against all negative side effects of a product or process.

Often, professionals can see the potential impact of their work and take proactive action to eliminate public risks. Thus, society expects professionals to:

- Provide significant benefits
- Avoid causing harm through their actions

One way to meet this expectation is to establish and maintain **professional standards** that protect the public.

---

## Societal Impact of IT Workers

The actions of IT workers can have a direct or indirect effect on society. For example:

- A **systems analyst** might design a computer-based control system for a chemical manufacturing process.
- If this system fails or has errors, it could endanger:
  - Workers
  - Local residents
  - The environment

As a result, IT workers have an **ethical responsibility** to consider how their actions affect the broader society.

Currently, there is no single formal organization responsible for establishing and maintaining industry-wide standards to protect the public from the impact of IT systems. However, various **professional organizations** do offer **codes of ethics** to guide IT workers.

## 🧠 Critical Thinking Exercise: Accept the Tickets or Not?

You are leading your organization’s effort to purchase and install new accounting software. The project will cost an estimated **$3 million**. Over the past few months, you have evaluated several potential vendors.

It’s early March, and the NCAA basketball tournament is underway. A sales rep from one of the vendors calls you and offers **two tickets** to a second-round game next weekend.

Consider the following questions:

- Can you accept this offer **without raising concerns**?
- How can you **politely decline** the offer without offending the sales rep?
- Would **accepting** the tickets **obligate** you in any way?
- Would you feel compelled to **share information** about how their firm is ranking in the vendor selection process?
- Would you be more inclined to **spend extra time** understanding their products?

> ⚠️ Ethical dilemma: Even seemingly small gifts can create a conflict of interest or the appearance of bias. Transparency, fairness, and professional integrity are key in such situations.

# Encouraging the Professionalism of IT Workers

A **professional** is someone who possesses the **skill**, **good judgment**, and **work habits** expected of a person with the training and experience to do a job well.

Many organizations—including those in IT—are urgently seeking professionals with the following characteristics:

- ✅ Expertise in tools and skills relevant to the job  
- ✅ High ethical and moral standards  
- ✅ Consistent delivery of high-quality results  
- ✅ Reliability in meeting commitments  
- ✅ Effective communication  
- ✅ Willingness to train and develop others with less experience  

---

## Ways IT Workers Can Promote Professionalism

IT professionals can improve the reputation of their field by:

1. **Subscribing to a professional code of ethics**  
2. **Joining and participating in professional organizations**  
3. **Obtaining appropriate certifications**  
4. **Supporting government licensing**, where available  

Each of these topics is explored further in the following sections.

# Professional Codes of Ethics

A **professional code of ethics** outlines the principles and core values essential to the work of a particular occupational group. Many professions adopt such codes to guide practitioners' behavior. 

For example, doctors adhere to versions of the 2,000-year-old **Hippocratic Oath**, often recited during medical school graduation ceremonies.

Most codes of ethics created by professional organizations consist of two parts:

1. **Aspirational Goals** – What the organization strives to become.  
2. **Rules and Principles** – Expected behaviors for members to follow.  
   
Many codes also emphasize a **commitment to continuing education**.

---

## Limitations of Laws and Codes

While **laws** guide behavior to some extent, they don’t fully define ethical standards. Similarly, no code of ethics can address every ethical dilemma. Still, adherence to a code of ethics provides significant benefits:

---

## Benefits of Following a Professional Code of Ethics

### ✅ Ethical Decision Making
- Provides a common set of core values to guide ethical decisions.

### ✅ High Standards of Practice
- Encourages professionals to uphold their responsibilities and resist compromising them under business pressure.
- Clarifies acceptable and unacceptable behaviors.
- In some professions, violations can lead to **censure** or **loss of practice rights** (though this is rare in IT).

### ✅ Public Trust and Respect
- Builds public confidence in professionals to act with integrity, avoid self-serving behavior, and warn of negative outcomes.
- Enhances the **credibility** of the profession.

### ✅ Evaluation Benchmark
- Offers a standard for **self-assessment** and for peer **recognition or censure**.

---

> While few strong enforcement mechanisms exist in the IT field, adopting and promoting a code of ethics is key to the profession’s growth and public trust.

# Professional Organizations

There is **no single, dominant professional organization for IT workers**, and therefore **no universal code of ethics**. However, several organizations play a key role in helping IT professionals:

- Stay up to date with rapid developments
- Build networks
- Sharpen skills and expertise
- Promote ethical and professional standards

Whether you're a freelance programmer or a Fortune 500 CIO, membership in a professional organization enables collaboration, idea exchange, and career development.

These organizations disseminate information through **email**, **magazines**, **websites**, **social media**, **meetings**, and **conferences**. Many also maintain **codes of ethics**.

# Licensing of IT Professionals

In the United States, a government license is government-issued permission to engage in an activity or to operate a business. Most states license activities that could impact **public health, safety, or welfare**—if practiced by someone without **minimal competence**. Licensing is generally **administered at the state level** and typically requires passing a test.

Some professions that require licensing include:
- Certified Public Accountants (CPAs)
- Lawyers
- Doctors
- Medical and daycare providers
- Some engineers

---

## The Case for Licensing IT Workers

Modern systems are:
- Highly complex
- Interconnected
- Critical to public safety and welfare

Examples:
- Braking and autopilot systems in vehicles and planes
- Nuclear reactor controls
- Military missile guidance
- Hospital life-support systems

**Failures in these systems can result in injury or death**, raising concern over whether IT professionals should be licensed.

### Arguments for Licensing
- Promotes **high standards** and **ethical behavior**
- Encourages **adherence to a code of ethics**
- Establishes **clear requirements** and **malpractice standards**
- Improves **public trust and system reliability**

---

## Efforts to Define IT as a Profession

In 1993, **ACM** and **IEEE-CS** formed a joint committee to:
- Define ethical standards
- Define required knowledge/practices
- Define appropriate curricula for software engineering

### Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice

Adopted by ACM and IEEE-CS (Version 5.2), includes **8 principles**:

1. **Public** – Act in the public interest.
2. **Client and Employer** – Serve client/employer while respecting public interest.
3. **Product** – Meet the highest professional standards.
4. **Judgment** – Maintain professional integrity and independence.
5. **Management** – Promote ethical management practices.
6. **Profession** – Advance the profession’s integrity and reputation.
7. **Colleagues** – Be fair and supportive.
8. **Self** – Engage in lifelong learning and ethics.

## Software Engineering Licensure

**NCEES** (National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying):
- Develops and administers licensure exams
- Partnered with **IEEE** to create an **8-hour exam** for software engineers

### Requirements for Licensure

A software engineering license certifies that the holder has:

- Completed a program **accredited by ABET**
- Gained **4+ years** of supervised experience (varies by state)
- Passed:
  1. **Fundamentals of Engineering (FE)** exam
  2. **Principles and Practices of Software Engineering** exam
- Met **continuing education** requirements

As of 2015:
- **40 states** support software engineer licensure
- 23 ABET-accredited software engineering programs exist in the U.S.

---

## IT Professional Malpractice

### Industrial Exemption

Most IT workers are not required to be licensed because they:
- Work **internally**
- Do **not release** products to the public
- Are **not offering services to the public**

However, if opening a **consulting practice** or formally calling oneself a “software engineer,” licensing may be required.

### Negligence & Duty of Care

- **Negligence**: Failing to act as a reasonable person would.
- **Duty of care**: Obligation to prevent unreasonable harm or risk.

**Professionals are held to higher standards**, based on their expertise.

#### Example:
If a **licensed DBA** deletes critical records, the court would judge their actions more harshly than those of an inexperienced analyst.

### Professional Malpractice

Malpractice = **breach of duty** causing injury or damage.
- Example: A **CPA** who fails to follow standards commits **accounting malpractice**
- Historically, **software engineers couldn’t be sued** for malpractice due to lack of licensure or defined standards

> Courts previously dismissed malpractice claims (e.g., *Chatlos Systems, Inc. v. NCR Corp.*, 1979)

# Ethics of Computing and Technology  
*Engaging Through Science Fiction*  
*The MIT Press, 2023*

---

## 1. Ethical Statements: Normative vs. Descriptive

Ethics is often misunderstood as being only **normative**—focused on what should be. In reality, even simple factual descriptions often embed subtle value judgments.

- **Normative Statements**: Assess how things *should* be.
  - Examples:
      - “He was wrong to do that.”
      - “Being kind is more important than being the most successful.”
  - Rooted in judgments about good/bad, permissible/forbidden, and the relative value of things.

- **Descriptive Statements**: Assess how things *are*.
  - Example:
      - A newspaper’s choice of “suspect,” “loiterer,” “passerby,” “boy,” or “juvenile” to describe a person arrested near a crime scene.  
        Each term meets factual criteria but communicates different normative judgments, shaping public perception.

**Key Point:** Every act of description involves choices, often unconsciously, that communicate values.

---

## 2. Ethics and Computing: The Invisibility Factor

James Moor identified the "invisibility factor" as a unique ethical challenge in computing:

1. **Invisible Abuse**: Exploitation through hidden or lower-level computer operations (e.g., silent manipulation during financial transactions).
2. **Invisible Programming Values**: Algorithms make decisions that advantage or disadvantage people in ways users cannot see.
3. **Invisible Calculations**: Computers perform complex calculations beyond human inspection or understanding.

**Reflection:**  
Always ask, “What is invisible in this technology? What values are embedded in the unseen?”

---

## 3. Technology’s Impact on Society (Deborah Johnson)

Deborah Johnson (1998) highlights three major societal changes due to computing technologies:

### a) Reproducibility
- Rapid, mass reproduction and transmission of information (texts, images, videos).
- Easier collection, linking, and preservation of records.
- Significant implications for privacy and record-keeping.

### b) Information Flow
- Shift from one-to-one and one-to-many communication to many-to-many (e.g., social media).
- Changes how knowledge is shared and accessed.

### c) Identity Conditions
- Increased connectivity and computation enhance both tracking and anonymity.
- Technology enables anonymous communication and action, but also facilitates pervasive surveillance.

---

## 4. Science Fiction: A Tool for Ethical Engagement

Science fiction immerses us in alternative sociotechnical worlds, helping us consider how societies and individuals adapt to and are shaped by new technologies.

**Application:**  
Analyze sci-fi scenarios to anticipate real-world ethical challenges.

---

## 5. Ethical Frameworks (Chapter 2, Page 45+)

### Learning Objectives
- Understand why multiple ethical frameworks exist.
- Identify and describe the key frameworks: **deontology**, **utilitarianism**, **virtue ethics**, and **communitarianism**.
- Contrast the traditions and applications of each framework.
- Critique classical frameworks using contemporary approaches (e.g., responsibility ethics, feminist ethics, capabilities approach).
- Formulate and analyze ethical tensions within stories and cases.

---

### Overview of Ethical Frameworks

#### **Deontology**
- **Focus:** Duties, rights, and moral obligations.
- **Principle:** Rightness/wrongness is determined by adherence to rules, not outcomes.
- **Divine Command Theory:** Morality based on obedience to God’s commands (Euthyphro problem: Are things good because God commands them, or does God command them because they are good?).

#### **Virtue Ethics**
- **Focus:** Human flourishing and character.
- **Principle:** Virtues are means between extremes (Aristotle’s "golden mean").
- **Examples:**  
    | Virtue      | Excess            | Deficiency             |
    |-------------|-------------------|------------------------|
    | Courage     | Recklessness      | Cowardice              |
    | Friendliness| Flattery/Fawning  | Hostility/Crankiness   |
    | Temperance  | Overindulgence    | Insensitivity          |
    | Generosity  | Wastefulness      | Stinginess             |
  - The suitable degree of virtue varies by situation and is guided by practical wisdom.

#### **Communitarianism**
- **Focus:** Interdependence, common good, self-realization within community.
- **Principle:** Social, spiritual, and psychological goods arise from relationships; isolation hinders self-realization.

#### **Utilitarianism**
- **Focus:** Happiness and outcomes.
- **Principle:** The greatest happiness for the greatest number; actions are judged by their overall effects.

---

## 6. Modalities for Judgment

- Ethical frameworks serve as lenses, not explicit formulas.
- Multiple frameworks may reach similar conclusions by different reasoning.
- Strong frameworks remain flexible for diverse contexts and challenges.

---

## 7. Key Takeaways

- Technology ethics requires consideration of both visible and invisible impacts.
- Ethical reasoning is a process—contextual, comparative, and often quantitative.
- Applied ethics asks: “How does this affect real people, now and in the future?”

---

## 8. Critical Questions for Practice

1. What invisible values or biases are embedded in the algorithms you use?
2. How does reproducibility challenge traditional privacy?
3. How do tech communities promote or hinder self-realization and collective well-being?
4. How can happiness or harm from technology be measured, and who decides the metrics?
5. Where do your own value judgments influence your technology assessments?

<p>in holy books or sacred writings. In other cases divine law is considered to be recieved through phropechy or through authoriatative leaders. The ethical weight of an actiong might also be interpreted as gaining its authority from a God or gods without neccessarily using the langauge of law.</p>

<p>Divine command theory is one form of deontology that derives its authority from God. Broadly speaking, divine command theory holds that moral obligations consist of obedience to God. Under divine command theory, an action is obligatory because God or the gods command it, and it is impermissible if God or the gods forbid it. If an action is neither obligatory nor forbidden, it is considered to be a permissible action (Quinn, 2006). Although the notion of God-given laws is conceptually straightforward, there is an interesting philosophical problem at their core: Did God (or the gods) give this law because it is right, or is the law right because it comes from God (or the gods)? This is sometimes referred to as the Euthyphro problem, referring to a dialogue written by Plato in which Socrates asks, "Is the pious loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods?" (Plato, *Euthyphro* 10a1–3). Most divine command traditions do not have a settled answer to this question, and it is a topic of ongoing philosophical and religious debate.</p>

### Sidebar: Obligations and Prohibitions

Deontology includes both obligations and prohibitions. Obligations (sometimes called "positive laws") are things that you should do and that require active effort on the part of the agent. By contrast, prohibitions (sometimes called "negative laws") forbid certain kinds of actions: they are obeyed not by undertaking a specific action, but by refraining from acting in a way that has been described as wrong.

Both obligations and prohibitions can be found in the Ten Commandments, which is one of the most well-known sets of laws based on divine authority. In the story recounted in the Five Books of Moses, which are sacred texts for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, the Ten Commandments are given by God to Moses. There are versions in *Exodus* and *Deuteronomy* that are similar but not identical, and some of the same laws are also repeated in *Leviticus*. In fact, the "canonical" sets differ somewhat among the three religions and among the different translations.

Obligations and prohibitions might seem like opposites in the abstract, but in practice there is a great deal of overlap. Consider these two laws, both of which appear in both versions of the Ten Commandments:

> 4) Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.  
> 6) Thou shalt not murder. (Exodus 20:3–4 KJV)

The first of these laws is clearly an obligation, and the second one is clearly a prohibition. But on closer inspection, the obligations can be seen to have some prohibitions built in, and the prohibitions might well require some specific positive actions.

Honoring the Sabbath is an obligation. Fulfilling this obligation is not something that just happens on its own; a Jew, Christian, or Muslim who is following this law has to do specific things in order to make it happen. But those specific things include actively avoiding some activities that one does on ordinary days, as part of the larger obligation to become more aware of the sacredness of life.

The second law, forbidding murder, is a prohibition. Much of the time, it can be followed simply by avoiding the forbidden action. But for someone who finds themselves in a position to kill another person, it might require active effort to refrain—especially if they are very angry or otherwise motivated to kill that person. In a situation like that—when, arguably, the prohibition against killing matters the most—abiding by the prohibition is likely to require some active, positive effort and not just pa

### The Authority of Human Reason

<p>The notion that human beings have an inherent moral compass that allows them to discern the difference between right and wrong is an ancient idea that became especially popular during the European intellectual movement known as the Enlightenment. Over the centuries, theologians and philosophers have linked this belief in the human's inherent capacity to judge between right and wrong to religious disposition and creation stories. In the book of Genesis, for example, the first humans are said to know the difference between right and wrong. Thomas Aquinas, a Christian philosopher and theologian, argues that the very first principle of practical reasoning (i.e., ethical reflection on human action) is quite simple: avoid evil and do the good (Aquinas, Summa Theologica I–II, 94, 2; see Aquinas 1948). Aquinas insisted that all human beings know this basic principle and therefore can discern the difference between right and wrong. While Aquinas appealed to divine authority to support this claim, he also linked this capacity to the human's ability to grasp the laws that govern and order the universe (i.e., natural laws).</p>

<p>Natural law theory as a tradition has also been articulated in less religious and metaphysical terms. As one theorist explains:</p>

> Natural law theory accepts that law can be considered and spoken of as a sheer social fact of power and practice, and as a set of reasons for action that can be—and often are—sound as reasons and therefore normative for reasonable people addressed by them. This dual character of positive law is presupposed by the well-known slogan "Unjust laws are not laws." (Finnis 2020)

> Natural law theorists do not hold that ethics is simply a matter of sensing the difference between right and wrong, nor do they claim that deciding what to do is easy. They point out that acting morally is very difficult and that it requires a certain amount of sacrifice. Even more, they tend to emphasize that even in those cases in which we know what the right choice is, we often fail to act in ways that are right and just. For someone with the outlook of Aquinas, this shows that natural reason needs to be supplemented and guided by religious texts and teaching. For secular theorists, this means that discerning what is right and wrong is never a private enterprise, but must be worked out in a social context in which people deliberate about the ends that are worth pursuing.

<h1>2.2.3(KANTIAN DEONTOLOGY)</h1>
<p>The notion that the universe is ordered by laws that can be apprehended by human reason was an especially popular belief in the eighteenth century, when Immanuel Kant was developing his philosophy. Kant's moral philosophy is similar to Aquinas's in that Kant believed that human beings are able to discern the difference between right and wrong. However, Kant was also writing at a time when people were becoming increasingly critical of claims that depended on religious authority—whether in the context of politics, of science, or of morality. And therefore Kant, like many other Enlightenment thinkers, rejected the idea that any code of law handed down in a religious tradition or promulgated by the state can successfully address the full breadth and complexity of right and wrong.</p>

<p>Kant acknowledged that external laws often aligned with the moral law in basic ways and that many (or even most) people require such externally given laws to remind them of their fundamental duties to others. He also believed that external laws can be valuable both as constraints on our behavior and as guidelines for our moral understanding. However, Kant insisted that human reason is the most important guide to making moral choices. Because Kant remains one of the most influential figures in moral philosophy, and because he is frequently described as a deontologist, it is worth explaining his approach to ethics in a little more detail.</p>

<p>Kant's version of deontology is uniquely universalist in scope. It starts from the assumption that all human beings are free and rational and that they are familiar with both the experience of being moved by desire and the experience of being moved by the feeling of duty or moral obligation. In response to this baseline assumption, Kant offers an account of what must necessarily be true in order for us to make sense of this universal experience of moral duty. He understood himself to be offering a "metaphysics of morals" in which he aimed to articulate the universal pattern of reasoning behind a moral judgment (Kant 1996).</p>

<p>According to Kant, the unity and intelligibility of the moral law is something all rational beings can grasp. The moral law, therefore, must be perfect and perfectly consistent in a manner similar to the order of nature. This means in practice that whereas all our particular duties to individuals, coworkers, family, and friends are important, they are conditional—therefore, they cannot describe the basic sense of duty that applies in every circumstance. For Kant, only those actions that are unconditional have moral value. So what kinds of actions are these?</p>

<p>For Kant, an action performed in accordance with a law or set of laws does not necessarily mean that the action has moral worth. Kant strongly believed that people should learn to think for themselves and never blindly follow any one law or set of laws. And even when following an external law is in order, that does not necessarily endow it with moral worth. In order for an action to have moral worth, it must be an action that you, the agent, recognize as right. But just as importantly, it must be binding for all rational agents. Otherwise, it would be, again, conditional. Only actions that meet both of these criteria have moral worth, according to Kant. Our capacity to act on such a law is the only indication that we are truly free agents.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular opinion, freedom is not about acting on whatever desires and impulses one might have in a particular moment, nor is it about following a rule to avoid punishment or condemnation. True freedom, Kant maintained, is the freedom to act according to a law that you can both apply to yourself and universally legislate for all. A law such as this is what Kant calls a categorical imperative, by which he means a law that is unconditionally and universally valid. His first formulation of this law is as follows:</p>

> Act only in accordance with that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law. (KANT 1996, 73)

<p>Let's consider what this means in more general terms. Kant's understanding of morality required us to evaluate an action using criteria identified by internal reasoning processes, rather than criteria drawn from outside legal codes and cultural norms. Before acting, a moral agent must always ask herself: "If I act in such a way, is this something I can legislate for myself and all other rational agents? Is it something I can continue to follow and expect others to do the same?" Lying is a classic example of an action that might seem justifiable in a particular instance but cannot be justified as a general practice. If you tell a lie, can you honestly and consistently legislate that action? Can you coherently argue that it makes sense, morally speaking, for everyone to be able to lie whenever it is convenient for them? If not, then clearly lying is unethical and therefore, a person shouldn't lie under any circumstances. Kant's categorical imperative, as he formulates it initially, is intentionally abstract. It is meant to capture something very basic about the experience of moral obligation. But he also offers a formulation that speaks more to how we are to treat others. His second formulation of the categorical imperative reads: "Act that you use humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means." (Kant 1996, 80) This second formulation of the categorical imperative is derived from an additional claim that because the human being is a rational creature and therefore capable of acting freely, all human beings should be treated with respect and dignity. Whenever we treat another person merely as a means to achieve some particular end, we are not only disrespecting that person; we are disrespecting all humanity, including ourselves.</p>

> 2.2.4 (Principles in Practice)

It might seem at first that all deontologists—or at least those who acknowledge the same authority behind moral principles or laws—would agree with one another about what the right action is in any given situation. But in practice, those who approach ethics from within a deontological framework—yes, even Kantians—disagree all the time. Although they may share the same general idea about the status of "the law" as the source of ethics and the only guide to ethical action, disagreement often arises around the meaning of that particular law and/or how it should be applied. Furthermore, most people recognize more than one system of law, even if they think that one (or more) of those systems is more important or that one system or code of law is limited in some way.

This introduces a difficult question: what is the right way to resolve an issue when different laws seem to prescribe conflicting solutions? When a person is duty-bound by more than one set of laws—for example, religious laws and laws of the state—how do they decide how to navigate conflicts between them or decide when one should take precedence over the other? What kinds of punishments are warranted by different kinds of violation? These are difficult questions to answer, but rather than providing decisive answers, most deontological traditions instead offer additional guidelines, suggestions, and even rules about how to proceed when conflicts and tensions arise.
> <h1>2.2.5 MODALITIES FOR JUDGMENT</h1>
<h1>BOOKMARK(pg)[60]</h1>

It is rarely possible to satisfy every single duty, or to satisfy them equally well, because circumstances often create tensions between our various duties. This is largely because regardless of their authority, deontology grounds its rules and laws in relationships. When our duties to different people pull us in different directions, or when a given duty relationship is multidimensional (such as a parent’s relationship to their child or a person’s relationship to their spouse), it is sometimes impossible to honor every duty, or every dimension of one’s duty. When these conflicts of duty arise—as they inevitably do—a moral agent is forced to make judgments about which duties should be prioritized over the others. For deontologists, these priority judgments cannot simply be a matter of personal preference—after all, the whole point of a duty is that it’s binding, even when it’s inconvenient or unpleasant. 
 

When balancing competing duties, a deontologist must consider the following two concerns. 
 
 
How Fundamental Is It? 
 

Which duty is most fundamental? Of the many duties competing for your attention and action, which ones are the most important to who you are and your role in the world? In a situation that compels a person to choose between protecting a stranger and protecting their child, nearly every deontologist would argue that it’s right and appropriate to protect the child, not because the agent has no duties at all to the stranger but because parents have particular duties toward their children. 
 

But this determination might be more complicated if the agent is an expert or professional (such as a doctor or a firefighter) who is trained to respond to the crisis at hand, because many such experts and professionals believe that their expertise imposes a specific obligation to use their skills and training to help others when possible, or have even signed onto a professional code that requires them to do so. Even if that parent still protects their child instead of the stranger, they may feel more keenly that they have failed in their duty to the other person. 
 
 
 
How Relevant Is It? 
 

Which duty is most relevant to the situation in question? When you are making a decision about a specific situation, it is often the case that some of your many duties are more pressing than others because of the particular circumstances. Imagine a soldier in a combat situation whose platoon-mate is injured in pursuit of the enemy. Should this soldier stop and assist her injured comrade, or complete the mission and kill the enemy? Both of these duties are important, but which is more relevant? The answer will depend on a number of very specific factors: how badly injured is her comrade? Is anyone else available to help him? How likely is it that there will be another chance to kill this enemy? 
 

It is worth remembering that for a civilian who is not bound to fight the enemy (and might even carry a strong prohibition against killing other people), this tension would be very different. Both soldier and civilian have a duty to help another person who is injured and in need, but the soldier has other duties that the civilian does not, and those duties might be more relevant than helping the wounded. 
 

These two criteria enable a deontologist to balance the basic obligations that shape their life (the fundamental) against the particular demands of specific circumstances (the relevant). When a deontologist deprioritizes a specific duty—for example, if the soldier above drops her pursuit of the enemy to assist her platoon-mate—that person is neither rejecting nor ignoring that one duty; rather, they are determining that the best way to honor the full range of their duties requires them to prioritize other duties over that one in this particular moment. 
 
 

Sidebar: Prioritizing the Right over the Good 
 

Unlike some other approaches to ethics, it is frequently said that deontology is not organized around the question of what is good, but rather it is primarily concerned with what is “right.” A system organized around “right” may initially seem more constricting than a system organized around goodness, because right/wrong is a binary system and goodness is not. 
 

But deontology actually allows for more freedom than goodness-based systems. A system concerned with goodness can encompass anything: any person, deed, or object can be evaluated in terms of how good it is compared to other things. When goodness is the metric for ethics, it’s (almost) always possible to get better, and being good requires that one constantly try to become better. A system of right and wrong, by contrast, leaves room for actions and experiences that are outside the bounds of ethical evaluation—that is, they are neither right nor wrong, and people can pursue those actions or not purely according to their preferences. 
 
 2.2.6 STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF DEONTOLOGY: IT’S NOT ALL ABOUT RULES 
 

One of deontology’s strengths is that it insists upon the notion that there is a difference between the rightness and wrongness of action, and it does so by appealing to factors that do not automatically depend on the way the outcome of that action is received. In this way, deontology preserves the integrity of ethical action: our choices have value, regardless of whether other people recognize that value. At its worst, deontological thinking can enable fanaticism, leading people to believe they are justified in punishing others for doing things they take to be wrong. At its best, deontology can afford people the moral courage to stand against the majority, even when there is no obvious reward for doing so. 
 

Another common criticism of deontology is that it does not focus enough on the consequences of action. Although it is true that deontology prioritizes human actions and intentions, as suggested above, most forms of deontology not only address but seriously consider the consequences and context of decisions and actions. Yet because of its emphasis on principles (laws, rules, and codes), deontology on its own seems to capture only a small portion of what it means to do ethics. And even more than that, it seems to operate as though the ethical life is a judicious process backed by a particular type of authority. In the mid-twentieth century, Elizabeth Anscombe offered a powerful argument against the legalistic language that was then dominant in moral discourse, arguing that without religious backing, such language makes very little sense and that therefore, unless we want to impose its religious significance upon everyone who wants to weigh in on matters of ethics, we ought to abandon it altogether. In her words: 
 

The concepts of obligation and duty—moral obligation and moral duty, that is to say—and of what is morally right and wrong, and of the moral sense of “ought,” ought to be jettisoned if this is psychologically possible; because they are survivals, or derivatives from survivals, from an earlier conception of ethics which no longer generally survives, and are only harmful without it. (Anscombe 1958, 1) 
 

Those forms of deontology that claim to ground the authority of moral principles and norms in human reason rather than divine decree have also been criticized. Kantian deontology in particular is frequently criticized for being overly rigorous and impractical. As noted, Kant insists that an action has no moral worth if it is not done out of duty. This means that, for instance, when someone donates to a charity and finds that the act brings them joy, and they decide to donate again and again, according to Kantian standards, this action has no moral worth. It is for reasons like this that people sometimes call Kant a moral purist or rigorist (Cohen 2014). Kant claims that a truly moral act is motivated by respect for the moral law and free from any other particular inclinations or desires. But human experience tells us that most of us act for a variety of reasons, and desire and emotion cannot easily be cast aside in order to evaluate the moral worth of particular actions—whether our own or someone else’s. 
 

But perhaps the most important issue that arises within a deontological framework concerns what to do when conflicting duties arise. Although we have described some of the ways deontology handles conflicts and inconsistencies, the fact remains that the principles and rules that guide human conduct are not always easy to follow nor are the choices between them always clear. Quite often, the complexity of our lives and circumstances makes it impossible to abide by all of the rules and duties that bind us, no matter what we do. The impossibility of choosing a perfect course does not mean that deontology has failed or that those rules or duties cease to be binding. Instead, these clashes of duty should be seen as the reason deontology is valuable: it furnishes us with a way of thinking, perceiving, and living that enables us to realistically navigate difficult choices about the things that matter most. That said, there are other ethical frameworks to consider and other points of emphasis to consider as well. 
 
 

Sidebar: The Challenges of Deontology and Artificial Intelligence 
 

For most deontologists, the right or wrong decision must always be a choice; otherwise, one cannot take responsibility for it. The agent may feel a strong sense of obligation, or the call to duty might be strong, but in order for responsibility to exist there must be a choice, and the agent must have the capacity to choose differently. Defining deontology becomes complicated when we start thinking about automated agents, which are programmed to do certain tasks and which learn new things according to programs that have been written by humans. Are automated entities exercising responsibility in the deontological sense? Could this be on the horizon? 
 

Deontology focuses on duties and obligations. What kinds of entities have duties and obligations? Typically, when we reference duties, rights, and obligations, we have in mind other people. But what are our duties with respect to other living creatures? And what about future generations? These are the types of questions deontology has traditionally asked. But new issues arise when we consider human beings’ relation to intelligent machines. What does a robot owe to a human? What does a human owe to a robot? What kind of demand can an artificial being make on human life, and how would that demand be justified? What these questions point to is a certain ambiguity about the nature of the relationship between humans and intelligent machines. If robots cannot have relationships with others, then what is at stake when we delegate a moral decision to a robot? 
 

There is a growing body of work in computer science and related fields called machine ethics (i.e., programming or teaching machines how to act ethically) (Christian 2020; Dubber et al. 2020; Lin et al. 2017; Pereira and Lopes 2020; Wallach and Asaro 2020). Work in this area typically takes one of two main forms. In the bottom-up approach, systems or agents are given examples of proper behavior and attempt to abstract from those what to do in particular situations. In the top-down approach, systems or agents are given a set of rules in some formal, logical language and are expected to incorporate these rules into the actions that they decide to take. An important stream of research in this area focuses on harnessing the creativity of complex machine learning methods while still enforcing that the agents make decisions in line with outside constraints or rules (Rossi and Mattei 2019). 
 

There has been a lot of press coverage of work in this area related to teaching autonomous cars how to act by surveying millions of people all over the world (Bonnefon et al. 2016). One key question for us is, do machines even have ethics? Whereas they can have rules or patterns of behavior, who or what is held responsible for the decisions they make? 
 

Consider self-driving cars. They are trained by being given “traces” of human drivers as well as a set of rules to follow. They observe human drivers obeying traffic laws, avoiding obstacles, stopping for errant pedestrians, and other actions. If an autonomous vehicle stops for a pedestrian, a moose, or a flock of ducklings in the road, can it be said to be acting ethically? Note that moose are large, and that hitting one can do significant damage to a vehicle and possibly the occupants of the vehicle as well as to the moose. Does it make it less ethical (or less of an ethical concern) to stop for a moose than for a smaller animal? Does the vehicle’s decision to stop for the ducklings come from a respect for life or from a societal consensus to not injure cute animals? 
 
 
 
Story Point: “Dolly,” by Elizabeth Bear 
 

     

    “She’s a machine. Where’s she going to get a jury of her peers? ” 
     

 

Can an android be a person, or could it become one? What obligations would its potential personhood impose on us? And how can those obligations be made visible to people or governments that assume they are only objects? These are the questions that Detective Roz Kirkbride and her partner Peter King end up wrestling with as they try to solve the murder of Clive Steele, who has been disemboweled by his new advanced-prototype home companion Dolly. “Dolly,” the story, offers a compelling window into how the framework of deontology can help us define and negotiate ethical conflicts. And the conundrum of Dolly herself illustrates both how our definitions and descriptions create the conditions for ethical analysis that follows. In so doing, it offers a way to understand how deontology gives us the resources to reevaluate baseline definitions and thus the duties and obligations that follow from them. 

2.3 VIRTUE ETHICS 
 

Virtue ethics is an approach to ethics organized around the idea of human flourishing and human excellence. Its basic assumption is that all human beings share some basic qualities of character, though we vary widely in how much we excel at those qualities and how we express them, and each of us gets better (or worse) at them according to our experiences. It further assumes that human beings are concerned with how to live the good life and that ethics is a subset of what it means to live a full and happy life. 
 
 
2.3.1 OVERVIEW OF VIRTUE ETHICS 
 

Unlike deontology and other approaches to ethics, where the focus is primarily on actions and intentions, virtue ethics focuses on the whole person: the qualities of character that they have and the patterns of living that issue from and reveal those qualities. That pattern of being is called a habitus. By cultivating excellence in a range of basic human capacities, called the virtues, a person likewise builds their capacity for a fulfilling life, because exercising these virtues is what enables them to live in alignment with their goals and desires (Hursthouse and Pettigrove 2016). For this reason, it is virtuous people who live happy and fulfilling lives (that is, who flourish): not because they are rewarded or deemed worthy by some external judge but because the practice of virtue helps them build and sustain a satisfying and rewarding life. 
 

Nobody is born virtuous. In fact, it’s not really possible to be virtuous until you are an adult, or at least old enough to maintain the practice of virtue from your own habitus, rather than because some external force like a parent or teacher imposes it on you (Hursthouse and Pettigrove 2016). This does not mean that we are born vicious. Rather, virtue is developed over time, by emulating exemplary people and by cultivating good habits (Vallor 2016). Parents, teachers, and culture play major roles in shaping a person’s habitus, especially while the person is young. 
 

Virtuousness is also not a one-time achievement, at any age. For one thing, virtue is complex: it is possible to excel in some virtues while being weak or inconsistent in others. In fact, most of us are like that (Athanassoulis 2000). Even more importantly, our capacity for any given virtue is not fixed: although a person’s habitus cannot change overnight, it can always shift by small degrees, and those small shifts can eventually add up to significant changes. It’s always possible—though never easy—to develop your capacity for a given virtue. It’s also possible to lose the capacity for a given virtue over time. Similar to physical muscles, virtues like courage or generosity grow stronger if you exercise them regularly, and they weaken if you don’t use them (Annas 2011). In other words, the exercise of virtue is not based simply on a theoretical understanding of the right thing to do, but through ongoing practice (Vallor 2016). 
 

Like deontology, virtue ethics is deeply concerned with the interior lives of individuals and why we do the things we do. In contrast to deontology, however, virtue ethics emphasizes the importance of actions as an indicator of a person’s character. Although any one individual action may be hard to interpret (or may even be misleading), the long-term pattern of a person’s actions across multiple contexts will reveal their character by indicating how well, to what degree, and in what ways they exercise those basic human capacities that are the virtues. 
 

Virtue ethics is a goal-driven framework for thinking about ethics. It aims toward the creation of good outcomes and of happy, flourishing people. From within a virtue ethics framework, these two goals are impossible to separate: a good society is good because it makes it possible for people to flourish and develop human excellence. 

 
2.3.2 WHAT ARE VIRTUES? 
 

Virtues are the basic building blocks of human character; they are fundamental qualities like kindness, playfulness, or self-respect. Virtues are not qualities that only some people possess; rather, a virtue is the capacity to exercise that quality. According to virtue ethics, every person is endowed with the same basic library of virtues, and the potential to excel in any of these virtues is part of our basic makeup. Therefore, what differentiates us from one another is not whether or not we possess a given virtue, but rather the degree to which we have developed (or our parents and teachers have developed in us) the ability to exercise that virtue. Within a virtue ethics framework, a chronic liar would be understood as being very deficient in honesty rather than lacking honesty entirely. Given the right conditions and a genuine desire on that person’s part to become more honest, they could over time develop a greater capacity for honesty. 
 

Virtues are revealed not through single actions but rather through patterns of action. For example, a single act of benevolence is not enough to know that a person is meaningfully kind or generous, because any number of external causes and internal motivations might have prompted that one benevolent action. It is only when a person shows benevolence in a range of circumstances that one can be confident that they have a well-developed capacity for benevolence (Sreenivasan, 2002). In the words of Rosalind Hursthouse, virtues “go all the way down”; having a well-developed capacity for a given virtue means that you will “notice, expect, value, feel, desire, choose, act, and react in certain characteristic ways” (Hursthouse and Pettigrove 2016). 
 

Thinking about human character in terms of virtues—that is, in terms of a common library of basic capacities—is useful in several ways. First, it helps us think comparatively about the differences between people (or even different versions of ourselves), because those differences can be understood as different ways of inhabiting or expressing the same basic qualities. Second, it provides us with a framework for thinking about how multiple aspects of a person’s character work in combination to shape how that person will act in a given moment. And finally, it equips us to think about how our environments can impact our character, by encouraging or reinforcing the exercise of some virtues and creating barriers to the exercise of others. 
 
 
 
2.3.3 CONFUCIAN VIRTUE ETHICS 
 

The predominant form of virtue ethics in East Asia comes from the teachings of the ancient Chinese philosopher Confucius (Latinized from Kongzi, or “Master Kong”). He was inspired by a desire to return to what he saw as the excellence of the earlier Zhou Dynasty social system in contrast to the turmoil of his own time (the late fifth century BCE). Over time after his death, his disciples compiled quotes attributed to him into the Analects (Legge [1861] 2017) and expanded the Confucian canon with other classics, such as the Mencius and the Doctrine of the Mean. 
 

In early Imperial China, Confucianism competed with other emerging ideologies known as the “Hundred Schools of Thought,” including the heavy-handed Legalism of the short-lived Qin Dynasty (221–206 BCE) and the more libertarian Daoism of the early Han Dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), to eventually become a principal guiding force for Han governance. The later neo-Confucian renaissance, emerging as a secularist response to the prevailing Buddhist and Daoist spirituality during the Song Dynasty (906–1279 CE), solidified Confucianism’s place in the core of Chinese philosophy up to the modern era (Yao 2000). 
 

In the Confucian tradition, our interpersonal bonds are a fundamental part of what makes us people; the project of growing as a person is one of developing mutual care and respect in our relationships as parent/child, teacher/student, friend/friend, and so on (Santiago 2008; Wong 2020). Though we are each given unique circumstances based on the family, nation, and other groups we are born into, we are all basically the same by nature at birth, and it is habituation that differentiates us (Analects 17.2). Confucius’s disciple Mencius posits that this nature includes the “seeds” that may eventually grow into the core virtues of ren (often translated as “benevolence”), yi (“righteousness”), li (“propriety”), and zhi (“wisdom”) (Yu 2013). 
 

An important tool for cultivating virtues in Confucianism is mindful exercise of social rituals (Wong 2020). Consider the practices of offering a handshake or bow to a business partner, reciting vows at a Western Christian wedding, holding a funeral when someone dies, and taking off one’s shoes before entering an Islamic mosque or a Hindu temple. Rather than intended to be enacted mechanistically, these rituals are meant to help the performer get into a mind-set of respect: for their colleague, for their marital commitment, for the deceased, or for the divine. This idea is central to how Confucius believed a society should be governed; although people might be coerced to behave well through the threat of punishment, a gentler route of teaching them to be virtuous through a system of meaningful rituals would promote flourishing as well as order. 

2.3.4 ARISTOTELIAN VIRTUE ETHICS 
 

In European and American philosophy, the prevailing form of virtue ethics can be traced to ancient Greece. Its foundational text is Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics, which was written around roughly 340 BCE, during the so-called Golden Age. The first sustained treatise on ethics produced in classical-era Greece, it remained very influential on Greek and Roman thought over the next several hundred years. Like most other Greek language works, the Nicomachean Ethics was not widely known in Latin-speaking Europe during much of the Middle Ages. But it remained popular in the Islamic world in Arabic translation and was “rediscovered” by Christian Europe during the twelfth century along with several of Aristotle’s works in other disciplines (such as formal logic, biology, and political theory), thanks in part to its preservation in Arabic. Within a few decades, the Nicomachean Ethics became the Western world’s definitive account of human nature and how to live well. In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, Aristotle was the single most important ancient thinker among Jewish, Christian, and Muslim thinkers, who referred to him in their writings simply as “the Philosopher” and who worked in various ways to harmonize the Nicomachean Ethics with their respective beliefs and practices. 
 

Aristotle’s goal in the Nicomachean Ethics is to ascertain what things a human being needs to do in order to achieve deep happiness and satisfaction with life—to flourish. He concludes that we need a rational understanding of what things make us happy and how those things can be acquired and kept. But he also argues that an understanding of general principles is not enough; we need particular qualities of character both to help us recognize the things that will make us happy and to ensure that we are able to pursue them effectively. These virtues exist in all of us in potential, and cultivating them will help us flourish. 
 

The Nicomachean Ethics lists 11 moral virtues that must be developed through habituation. Later proponents of Aristotelianism have revised and adapted this list in various ways, either to integrate Aristotelianism with another specific system of thought (such as Islam) or to help it better match the world as they saw it. Some of the virtues that consistently feature across different Aristotelian traditions are courage, generosity, friendliness, temperance, and concern for justice. In order to flourish, one must also have a well-developed sense of practical wisdom, or the understanding of how best to act in a given situation. For Aristotle, acting in a manner that appears virtuous is not sufficient evidence that a person is virtuous. Rather, that person must either be acting out of deep inclinations of their character or because they know that those actions are good and have chosen them for that reason (Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics 2.4/1105a16–1105b20). 

2.3.5 APPETITES, DESIRES, AND VIRTUOUSNESS 
 

Because virtue ethics is concerned with the whole life of the moral agent, it considers more than our actions and intentions. It also considers our basic physical appetites like hunger and fear, and our emotional or psychological desires. The fact that these appetites and desires are a basic part of human nature means that they are fundamentally good for humans, and necessary for us to flourish. Of course, any of these appetites can be damaging to a person if they are indulged to excess or at the expense of other good things (Schwitzgebel 2007). But suppressing the appetites entirely is just as damaging to a person as allowing them to expand out of control. That is why virtue ethics insists on the importance of learning to regulate appetites and desires and to exercise them in moderation. 
 

But not all ways of regulating desires and appetites are the same, even though they might look the same from the outside. Most of us are familiar with the experience of turning down something that we want—a piece of cake, or the answer key to tomorrow’s big exam—because we know that we will be better off without it, in one way or another. This forcible restraining of one’s own appetites or desires is called continence. A person can cultivate their capacity for continence in the same way that they can cultivate virtues. But continence is not itself a virtue, because it requires us to suppress our desires and appetites. 
 

A different and better way to ensure that you exercise your appetites and desires appropriately is to train yourself into wanting to do what is right. This alignment of desires with right action appears in the Aristotelian tradition as the virtue of temperance, that is, having appetites that are attuned with what is right, and in the Confucian tradition by a state of being that can be called wholeheartedness, in which one does not feel internal resistance or conflict but is genuinely and joyfully committed to a course of action or way of being. If you have ever been really excited to work on a class project or found yourself saying no to dessert because you feel pleasantly full after a good meal, then you have an idea of what these things refer to. 
 

Continence has much more in common with temperance and wholeheartedness than it does with various forms of bad living, such as vice (that is, the extreme states of being that virtues avoid) or being ruled by one’s appetites. Very broadly speaking, for there is a great deal of disagreement among thinkers and sages, the Confucian tradition raises serious concerns about relying on continence, worrying that it could lead a person to become more concerned with the outward appearance of virtue rather than true virtuousness (Angle 2013). The Aristotelian tradition, broadly speaking, is more positive, celebrating continence as the exercise of the rational part over the nonrational and perceiving it of one’s progress toward temperance (Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics 1.13, 1102b26–28; Scarre 2013; Stohr 2003). 
 

But across traditions, there is widespread agreement that true virtue requires more than continence: it requires that a person truly want to do what is right and best. This isn’t just because calibrating your desires with your judgment means that you will reliably do the right thing, although that’s also true; it’s because doing so is what will make you happy. And that, after all, is what flourishing is: living a satisfying and fulfilling life. 

2.3.6 HABITUATION: DEVELOPING VIRTUE 
 

Every culture educates its children into its own ideas about what virtues are important and how those virtues are expressed and recognized. This education can come in the form of intentionally crafted lessons, or in simple immersion in the daily workings of that culture. This cultural training, in all its official and unofficial forms, is known as habituation. 
 

As a person grows to adulthood, his patterns of thought and action—all of which are influenced by his home culture(s), even if they are a reaction against it—become more entrenched until they seem like the “normal” way of being for him. This normal way of being is called a habitus, or interlocking set of habits that are what feels right or natural for him. To have a habitus does not mean that one doesn’t understand that there are other ways to live in the world or that those other ways can be ethically valid. It is simply to have habits of one’s own. 
 

A large part of a person’s habitus comes from doing the things that seem “normal” in their country, in their community, in their family, and among their friends. In general, people are far more aware of those aspects of their habitus that set them apart from their friends, family or neighbors. This is because the similarities are often understood to be “normal,” or “just how people are,” to the point that people do not notice them at all. 
 

According to virtue ethics, and possibly according to your own experience as well, new habits—whether virtuous or vicious—are hard to cultivate, and old habits are hard to break. But though it is not easy, it is possible. Through steady, deliberate choice on the part of the agent, or steady exposure to a new set of circumstances, an agent can gradually become habituated to a new pattern or set of patterns. In this way, people can (and do) become more or less virtuous over time. 
 

Most people never become perfect in any virtue, let alone in all of them. For this reason, it is better to think of virtue as a spectrum rather than as a binary. You can become more courageous than you were before without being perfect at it, or less generous than you were while still retaining some generosity. Although habitus makes it easy to keep doing what we are doing already, it is always possible to cultivate greater virtue, or to let a virtue lapse. To put it another way, virtues are not a pass/fail system—you’re almost always somewhere between perfectly virtuous and perfectly vicious—and your grade is never final. 

2.3.7 HOW THE VIRTUES WORK IN TANDEM 
 

Virtues do not exist in isolation from one another or from the rest of our character; they are our character, operating in complex combinations in everything that we do (Chen 2015). This is not because virtue ethics considers every single action to be moral in the narrow sense, but because plenty of qualities that are not obviously moral, such as physical prowess or technical knowledge, can also be understood as virtues, even though Aristotle did not consider them to be such (Putman 1997; Stalnaker 2010). 
 

By thinking about each virtue as one element of an interrelated whole, it can become easier to see how virtues that are not obviously moral, like technical skill or physical strength, can also have moral significance (Putman 1997). Imagine, for example, that a friend of yours is organizing a fundraiser for a charitable cause that you also support, and this friend asks you to donate your time to build a website to manage fundraising for the event. In donating your time, you are exercising the recognizably moral virtue of generosity. But you will need more than generosity to build a site that is appealing, easy to find, and easy to navigate: you will also need programming and human-computer interaction skills, as well as knowledge about handling charitable donations, Paypal and credit card accounts, and perhaps the logistics of relevant tax law. These are technical skills that could be used for many purposes: you could get paid for these same skills by your employer (which is reasonable and responsible, but not particularly generous) or you could donate them to build a website to steal credit card numbers. Being good at designing webpages does not make you generous, but it does make your generosity more effective in this situation. It’s also the case that both your generosity and your skill in web design will be more valuable if you are practiced at them. However, note that a very skilled and practiced designer who said yes would be exercising less generosity than a novice designer who did—after all, the experienced designer can fulfill her pledge with a lot less time and hassle. Likewise, a person who is unused to being generous may agree to build the website but is far less likely to follow through in putting in the time and energy required to build and maintain a successful and appealing site. 

2.3.8 MODALITIES FOR JUDGMENT 
 

Because virtue ethics takes a character-based approach to the world, it cannot and does not aim to offer principles or formulae that can be equally well applied by any person. Instead, it focuses on ways in which a person can draw on the resources of their character to attend to the particularity of specific situations (which, after all, are the only kind of situations we ever experience). Of course, a person of underdeveloped virtues will find these modalities much less useful than a person of good character. Likewise, a person of excellent character is far less likely to need to use these modalities consciously, as they will emerge organically from that person’s habitus. 
 

Because our character—including our ability to make use of the following modalities—creates the conditions for how we perceive, interpret and act, a virtue ethicist might say that any given decision is 95% made by the time you realize that you have to make it. Therefore, the best way to engage in good decision making, according to virtue ethics, is to cultivate those capacities that you want to be able to bring to bear in deciding and acting, by building good habits and modeling yourself after exemplary people. 
 
 
Practical Wisdom 
 

The key to acting well in virtue ethics is practical wisdom, or the ability to judge what the best action would be in any given situation. Practical wisdom is conceptualized differently by different virtue ethics traditions, but it is central to all of them. A person with a well-developed sense of practical wisdom will be able to perceive and understand the precise nature of what is going on in a specific set of circumstances and will likewise understand what kind of response that moment requires (Vallor 2016). This understanding and response necessarily combines perceptual acuity with the desire to do what is good; a person who delivers cutting insults at exactly the moment when they will hurt most might be said to be clever or perceptive in ways that partially resemble practical wisdom, but such a person is not practically wise (Clarke 2010; Yu 1998). In keeping with virtue ethics’ character-based approach to living well, practical wisdom is itself a virtue, which an individual must develop over time. 
 

Practical wisdom can be developed only through experience. For this reason, children and teenagers cannot yet possess practical wisdom and shouldn’t be expected to. If this distinction seems unfair to you, consider the difference in how we might evaluate a well-intentioned teenager who disregards a friend’s statement that they hate surprise parties and throws one for the friend anyway, as opposed to a well-intentioned adult who does the same (Hursthouse and Pettigrove 2016). It’s not hard to imagine the teenager being genuinely surprised and distressed to learn that their friend’s preferences do not match their own, because teenagers have had less exposure to a wide variety of people with different temperaments and preferences. We as observers might have known the party would backfire, but this does not necessarily lead us to doubt the good intentions of the teenaged party planner. By contrast, the party-throwing adult has had many more years of interacting with others, and thus has had more time to develop the perception and judgment that could help them distinguish between another person’s genuinely felt dislike of surprise parties and their self-effacing concern that they are causing fuss for their friends. Whether or not we doubt the sincerity of the adult party-planner’s good intentions, we are more likely to think of them as at fault for the hurt they cause. Though neither the teenager nor the adult has exercised practical wisdom in deciding to plan the party, it is likely only the adult whose actions will make us think “they should have known better.” 
 

Practical wisdom is culturally specific, in multiple ways. Firstly, a person who excels in practical wisdom will always be informed by their own culture and time period’s specific ideas of what constitutes flourishing (Vallor 2016). Secondly, a given action or way of being will not elicit the same response across time and place—for example, what seems appropriately friendly in one setting might come across as cold or distant in another—and being attuned to that local variation is part of what practical wisdom entails. Therefore, it must by definition be calibrated to the specifics of its setting. 
 

Practical wisdom guides the exercise of other virtues, but it cannot replace them. Imagine, for example, that you and a friend are having an argument and that you both have gotten very angry. Then your friend says something that makes you understand the whole situation differently. If you have a well-developed sense of practical wisdom, you might be able to perceive how your friend’s comment offers an opportunity to de-escalate the argument and make peace. But unless you are also disposed to let go of your anger—or at least capable of controlling it—you might not be able to make good use of that opportunity, even though your practical wisdom tells you that it would be a good idea. 

Finding the Mean 
 

As you have probably already noticed, virtue ethics is organized around the idea of moderation. Acting virtuously requires finding the middle path between excess and deficiency (Nicomachean Ethics, Book II.7 p. 25; Analects 15:3). It also requires that we pay attention to the specifics of a situation, because different situations require different responses: the right amount of courage (or cheerfulness, or honesty) for one occasion might be excessive for a different one (Lunyu, cited in Xia 2020). This point of perfect balance between extremes is known in the Confucian tradition as “the doctrine of the mean” (Zhongyong, cited in Plaks 1999) and in the Aristotelian tradition as “the golden mean.” 
 

To understand how a virtue could be exercised excessively, imagine a soldier who is considering a risky solo strike attack to provide cover for the other soldiers in his unit. Carrying out such an attack would be brave, regardless of circumstances. But in some situations, it might be too brave—in other words, reckless. A hot-blooded soldier who is immune to fear can make things worse by rushing in even when there is no advantage to be gained or when she is not sufficiently skilled to succeed. The most virtuous soldier, therefore—the one who possesses not only courage and skill, but also sufficient practical wisdom to pay attention to the mean—is the one who is unafraid to fight when it will be helpful, but not so eager that he fails to think about tactics. 
 

Aiming for the mean can give you a concrete method for imagining what excessive or deficient responses would look like and enable you to come up with a better course of action in order to avoid those extremes. But realistically, achieving the mean also requires a well-developed faculty of practical wisdom. And doing the right thing also requires you to have developed all the relevant virtues to the degree that the situation requires, so that you are able to go beyond just having the right idea about what a good response would be. 

Sidebar: Aristotelian Virtues as a Mean between Vices 
 

In the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle describes the moral virtues as existing at an intermediate point between two extremes of vice. (Aristotle 2.8) The following table lays out some of the moral virtues described in the Nicomachean Ethics, along with the vices that represent an excessive or deficient exercise of that same quality. Presenting them grouped together in this way should make clearer what “finding the mean” looks like in practice. 
 
 
	

This virtue is the midpoint
	

between this excess
	

and this deficiency
	
	

courage
	

recklessness
	

cowardice
	
	

friendliness
	

flattery and fawning
	

crankiness
	
	

temperance
	

overindulgence
	

lack of appreciation for pleasures
	
	

generosity
	

careless overspending
	

stinginess
	
 
 

It’s worth noting that the precisely suitable degree of exercising a given virtue (known in the Aristotelian tradition as the golden mean) will not be the mathematical center point between the two extremes and will vary from situation to situation. For this reason, one’s exercise of virtue needs to be guided by practical wisdom. 

2.3.9 STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF VIRTUE ETHICS: FLOURISHING IS EASY (ONCE YOU’RE THERE) 
 

A person is said to be truly virtuous only if they find it easy to be virtuous: they are wholehearted in their desire to do what is right, and they do not require continence or external pressure to continue in virtuous habits. 
 

Connecting virtue to flourishing in this way—to a person’s felt desire to act virtuously—may seem counterintuitive at first glance. Isn’t it more courageous to be brave when an action one must take is extremely dangerous (e.g., rescuing a child by running into a burning building), or more impressively generous for a very poor person to donate money to a disaster relief organization after a major flood? These are indeed two examples of exceptional virtue, in which the agents are being virtuous under conditions of extreme external pressure. Both of them are exercising their respective virtues (courage and charity) in spite of the risks it poses to them, in a way that suggests that they truly excel at those respective virtues (Foot 1978). 
 

But if a person finds it difficult to be virtuous because it does not match their internal desires and values—in other words, because they don’t entirely want to be—then that difficulty reflects the limits of their wholehearted commitment to that virtue (Foot 1978; Tiwald 2018). In comparison to the two people in the paragraph above, imagine a person who speaks up in a meeting despite being nervous, or who donates money to disaster relief even though she dislikes giving money away. In both cases, these actions are difficult because of insufficient virtue (courage or generosity) on the part of the actor. That is not to say that these actions aren’t good! In addition to the contributions they are making, both of these people are controlling their less virtuous impulses, and possibly building new habits. Both of these people might be on that path to greater virtuousness if these actions represent part of an overall shift in habitus. The timid speaker may find it easier to talk next time, and the resentful donor may donate again because it made her feel good the first time. But it’s impossible to know whether either of those things will happen on the basis of only those first, single actions. The actions a person undertakes to shift their habitus are best understood in the long term: in six months, or six years, each of these people may have become more virtuous than they were before, by cultivating new habits (or shaking off old ones). 
 

Being truly virtuous also requires maintaining those virtues across interactions with different people; for instance, a truly generous person finds it easy to help strangers as well as friends and family. But virtue ethics does not necessarily emphasize universality in the same way as some other ethical frameworks. It comes naturally to many people to feel the most concern for the people closest to them. In fact, in the Confucian tradition, familial love is the root of all other love and it is reasonable to give greater moral priority to these relationships (with filial piety being one of the most important virtues); to become a generally moral person is to take your circle of care for those closest to you and expand it outwards to encompass others (Curzer 2018; Yu 2007; Zhu 2002). 
 

While virtue ethics’ attunement to local norms is one of its strengths, this same quality is often criticized as a weakness. Because the virtues celebrated by one community are sometimes very different from the virtues celebrated by another, virtue ethics does not furnish a good foundation for universal principles, including a universal principle of justice. Virtue ethics has also been criticized for conceiving of the good life in a way that makes it difficult, if not impossible, for people with some disabilities or neurodivergencies to meet its criteria for human excellence. In particular, Furey (2017) has argued that virtue ethics is a problematic fit for engineering ethics in particular, because Aristotle’s picture of flourishing presupposes a model of the human mind with strong capacities for emotionally engaged and intuitionistic decision making, and those capacities don’t come as naturally to many people on the autism spectrum, a population particularly heavily represented in engineering. 
 
 

Sidebar: Understanding Virtue Ethics through Role-Playing Games 
 

One potentially useful way to think about the cultivation of virtues is role-playing games (RPGs), in which it is necessary to build your character’s skills slowly over time in accordance with your goals for the character. Although skill building in RPGs is not always presented as having a specifically moral dimension, the underlying mechanics can be helpful for thinking about virtue ethics. 
 

When you start out playing a game like Baldur’s Gate, Fallout, or Mass Effect, you have an array of skills, but you’re not very good at any of them yet. If you want to get better at climbing or communication or spell-casting, then you have to practice. As you practice, your ability level improves. This practice is not so different from habituation, the building-up or cultivation of a certain virtue through practice. It’s also not so different from practicing a sport or a musical instrument. 
 

Moreover, the best way to solve any given problem is not going to be the same for every player. Some challenges are simply impossible for lower-level players who have not yet built up their skills to the necessary point. Other challenges will have different solutions. How do you get past a locked door? Your answer will depend on whether your character is a magician or a thief. 
 

In an RPG, the mage and the mercenary will be able to address a given challenge differently because of their different skill sets, but the way the player perceives the problem is likely to be consistent. In the real world, the differences between the mercenary and the mage will go deeper: what seems possible or reasonable to the mercenary (defeat a guard in combat, break through a door) will seem imprudent or impossible to the mage, whereas the mage’s solution (unlock the door with magic) will seem fanciful or impossible to the fighter. Each character’s habits of thinking will be shaped by their past habits, and by the virtues or skills that have in their experience been relevant to making important decisions. 
 

Of course, in real life you don’t usually have the choice to put a challenging situation on hold and come back when you have leveled up: you have to face it when it confronts you. That’s why it is important not to put off cultivating your capacity for virtue until later. You might have to fight the dragon tomorrow. 

Story Point: “The Gambler,” by Paolo Bacigalupi 
 

     

    I try to protest. “But you hired me to write the important stories. The stories about politics and the government, to continue the traditions of the old newspapers. I remember what you said when you hired me.” 
     

    “Yeah, well.” She looks away. “I was thinking more about a good scandal.” 
     

    “The checkerspot is a scandal. That butterfly is now gone.” 
     

    She sighs. “No, it’s not a scandal. It’s just a depressing story. No one reads a depressing story, at least, not more than once. And no one subscribes to a depressing byline feed.” 
     

 

How can we be the version of ourselves that we want to be, even in times of crisis or under pressure from the outside world? And how can we influence the world around us for the better when the world doesn’t necessarily want to be influenced in those ways? These universal questions take on particular sharpness for Ong, a Laotian refugee who works as a journalist for a major American media company. Ong writes articles about the issues he considers most important, such as climate change and the fallout of government mismanagement. But such articles don’t align very well with the reading habits of the American public, who instead give their clicks to product reviews and celebrity scandals. “The Gambler” offers us several high-stakes moments, but among the various characters in the story—Marty Mackley, the master of infotainment; Janice, Ong’s results-oriented boss; Kulaap, who balances her Laotian and American identities in a way Ong cannot quite understand; and of course Ong himself—there is no consensus on what kind of response those high-stakes moments call for. Indeed, there is not even consensus on what really counts as a high-stakes moment in the first place: each character has different judgments about the lines between “real news,” distractions, and depressing stories. But as “The Gambler” illustrates, our choices in those moments are rooted in the longer arc of our character. 

2.4 COMMUNITARIANISM 
 

Communitarianism is an approach to ethics organized around self-realization in the context of interdependence. Its basic assumption is that human beings exist in a state of mutual reliance on one another (Masolo 2010; Smith-Morris 2020). Although this interdependence includes material goods like shelter and safety, the more significant dimension of our interdependence concerns the many social, spiritual, and psychological goods that can only come from relationships with others. Because we are interdependent, everybody benefits from investing in the common good, or the well-being of the community as a whole (Masolo 2010; Wiredu 1992a). 
 
 
2.4.1 OVERVIEW OF COMMUNITARIANISM 
 

Instead of conceiving of communities as collections of individuals who have decided to make common cause, communitarianism posits that communities exist prior to any individual born and raised within them (Menkiti 1984). By furnishing the language, values and relationships that form the basis of an individual’s experience, a community is necessarily foundational to understanding the character, goals, and potential of any individual within it. Furthermore, because of our interdependence, that individual’s self-realization—that is, the fulfillment of the individual’s potential and aims for themself—can take place only in a community setting, because relationships with others are essential to the structure and development of the self and because they create the context that makes an individual’s aims significant (Gyekye 1997, Masolo 2010). 
 

The idea of community that underwrites communitarianism does not include every single kind of community that exists. Rather, it refers to the kind of community in which a person might be said to have grown up. It requires not only shared interests and values among members but a sustained mutual commitment and a developed sense of what it means to live in common (Coetzee 2003; Gyekye 1992). There are many communities that have some of these qualities, but not all of them. You will likely find that the communitarian framework is helpful in reflecting on how these communities work, but that focusing on one such community to the exclusion of others will give you only a piecemeal picture of the lives of its members. 
 

While communitarian ethics does not presume any one community structure or set of norms, it does presume that communities exist and that they have structure and norms of some kind that they recognize and claim as their own. It further posits that any person can and must be understood as being formed by a community (or perhaps more than one). Being formed in this way means that an individual shares in the social meanings of their communities, and that their understanding of themselves and of the value of their goals is grounded in those shared social meanings (Masolo 2010; Smith-Morris 2020). This is not to deny that there are people who conduct their lives without strong social ties or a sense of shared commitment to others. But according to the baseline premises of communitarianism, any person who lives in isolation from a community of shared values and ideals—“an abstract dangling personality,” to use Polycarp Ikuenobe’s striking phrase—will not be able to achieve self-realization (Ikuenobe 2006). 
 

Although it does not presume any specific moral or social norms, communitarianism does make some general assumptions about how communities work. The first is that they are enduring and have patterns, processes, and structures that exist prior to the individuals who are formed by them (Menkiti 1984; Smith-Morris 2020). The second is that their shared wisdom is carried to a large extent by elders, who are not merely the older members of the community but are those who have excelled in the forms of living that the community values, particularly in sympathetic awareness of the needs of others (Masolo 2010; Menkiti 1984; Smith-Morris 2020). Both of these assumptions are more broadly and transparently applicable to people who spend most of their lives in one place, a pattern of life that is increasingly uncommon. Nonetheless, when you use the lens of communitarianism to think about your own life, you will likely find that you belong to some communities that match this description, even if your life does not take place entirely within them. 
 

In order to grasp why the communitarian framework presumes interdependence, it’s helpful to understand the role that community plays in a person’s self-realization. Even though you as an individual can decide what kind of person you want to be and what achievements are important to you, you (like everyone else) rely on others in order to become that person and achieve those goals, in three distinct but interrelated ways. 
 

The first way is that others in your community furnish you with many kinds of support in your work and development, from material goods (like food and public roads) to emotional and psychological goods (like love and conversation). The second way is that achieving your goals for yourself, whether in practical accomplishments or in character, rarely feels satisfying or even real unless somebody else recognizes and affirms what you have achieved or become (Gbadegesin 1991; Presbey 2002). Shared social rituals like weddings, coming-of-age ceremonies, and graduations are easily visible examples of how a community marks an individual’s achievement or growth. But even small ordinary gestures of recognition like a professional title are often important for helping someone feel that their achievements are real and valuable. 
 

The third way individuals depend on their community for self-realization is rooted in the fact that communities exist prior to individuals and supply the shared social meanings that individuals use to think about their lives (Smith-Morris 2020). Imagine, for example, that you have grown up in a community where most people want to be professional athletes, but you are more interested in becoming a doctor. Although you may think that this goal sets you apart from your community, the specific shape of your goal is still shaped by your community. Every society has medical practitioners of some kind, and different communities have very different ideas about the social role that medical practitioners play. These varying expectations occur not only because the nature and rigor of medical training varies widely but because different communities have different degrees of trust in what the doctors they know claim to do (or whether they will do what they claim). Even if your desire to be a doctor is unusual in your community, your specific ideas about being a doctor will reflect your own community’s understanding of what doctors are like and what makes that a valuable goal. 
 

For these reasons, your self-realization needs to be understood in the context of your community. Your community also shares in your attainments, whether it is achieving a concrete goal or becoming an excellent person (Ikuenobe 2006). Not only has the community helped to support you along the way, but the fact that you aimed for and achieved that goal is understood as a sign that the community has successfully raised and educated you to carry on the community’s values and practices (Menkiti 1984). This does not mean that every single community you have belonged to plays an equal role in your development and your successes, but it does mean that these things can be traced back to a community that has been important to you. 

2.4.2 SOURCES OF COMMUNITARIAN ETHICS 
 

The form of communitarianism discussed here is rooted in indigenous philosophy, traditions and lived community practices. This type of communitarianism is challenging to represent here, for several reasons. It’s important to discuss those reasons here, because they may already be influencing the way you are thinking about this framework. 
 

The first difficulty has to do with the challenge of retrieving sources of indigenous thought. Communitarianism was a common form of life in many parts of the world prior to the era of European colonization which began in the fifteenth century CE, including the lands that now comprise Australia, sub-Saharan Africa, much of North America, and parts of Southeast Asia. The societies in these regions were transformed, often violently, when their homelands were “discovered” and settled by European explorers, who largely treated these societies’ lands (and sometimes the people themselves) as a source of wealth for their home countries. During these violent upheavals, large swaths of these indigenous communities’ knowledge and tradition were eradicated. Some strands of knowledge and tradition were preserved in the minds and memories of survivors but in decontextualized forms that were different from those of prior generations. Our contemporary knowledge of those past ways of life is indelibly shaped, and limited, by that destructive history. 
 

In addition to this very practical challenge, there is also a conceptual challenge. European nations justified their colonial project by claiming that the peoples they conquered were lesser forms of humans—or not even human at all—because they were not “rational” in the same way (Ani 2013; Biakolo 2003). The idea that humanness depends on rationality can be traced to ancient Greece and, indeed, was used by Aristotle and other Greek philosophers to denigrate some non-Greek peoples (Biakolo 2003). But the specific form of rationality that mattered to the Europeans of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries was the newly developed principles of “scientific reasoning” (Naudé 2019). Because the worldviews and thought patterns of the indigenous societies that they encountered did not mesh with their own recently developed ideas about universal reason, the colonizers (along with observers in their home countries) concluded that these communities were incapable of higher-level thought, or at least had not developed it yet (Biakolo 2003; Nicholas 2018). Although it is easy to look back and see the error and hubris of that judgment, its legacy continues to shape how non-European peoples and their knowledge traditions are perceived today—including in the field of ethics, which (like many academic disciplines) is only just beginning to reckon with how some of its standards and practices continue to make it inhospitable to non-European traditions of knowledge (Ani 2013; Hallen and Sodipo 1997; Outlaw 1987; Oyěwùmí 1997; Serequeberhan 2003; Wiredu 1992b; see also Wiredu 2009). 
 

Many of the indigenous communitarian societies mentioned above continue into the present, adapting the core practices of communitarian ethics to the institutional structures of the settler states that now control their homelands (Smith-Morris 2020). For both practical reasons and because of ingrained philosophical biases, these communities’ frameworks and traditions are rarely given the same philosophical credence as writings from the European traditions. Yet indigenous communitarianism significantly enriches our conceptual vocabulary for doing ethics. 
 

Although these various indigenous communitarian traditions have many points of overlap among them, limitations of space make it impossible to discuss commonalities in a way that can truthfully represent them all. Therefore, the remainder of this unit focuses specifically on the communitarianism of sub-Saharan Africa, which is internally diverse but also coheres around a handful of core ideas and themes. Among these shared ideas is a particularly well-developed conceptual apparatus for communally based self-realization. 
 

The communitarian framework presented here cannot be, and does not aim to be, a direct representation of what precolonial Africa was “really like.” Instead, it offers an overview of the philosophical efforts by African scholars to theorize, systematize and reflect on those aspects of noncolonized African culture that endure, or those elements of precolonial Africa that can be recovered. 
 

It should be noted that communitarian philosophy and practices have also emerged in the culture and thought of Europe and America (Masolo 2010). Political philosophers Michael Sandel and Michael Walzer and philosopher/theologian Alisdair MacIntyre have each argued for the merit and moral urgency of a turn to communitarianism, responding to and drawing from the Euro-American tradition (MacIntyre 2013; Sandel 2010; Walzer 1990). As these thinkers all note, communitarianism is deeply at odds with the structure of the modern western capitalist state. Nonetheless, several communitarian movements have developed. One of the most widespread of these is the Catholic Worker Movement, which began in the United States in the early 1930s as a means to bring about a “society in which it will be easier to be good” (Cornell 2006). Initially just a newspaper, this movement soon expanded to include both independent houses and cooperative farms. The Catholic Worker Movement now has over 100 houses and farms in several countries that feed the needy and house communal workers and continues to stand against exploitation and inequality (Forest 2010). Another well-known example is the kibbutz movement. A kibbutz is a form of communal living first established in 1910 at Dgania in Palestine. The founding ideals of the kibbutz movement combined an agrarian communitarianism with the Zionist goal of claiming land for the Jewish people. Kibbutzim (to use the Hebrew plural) were founded on a purely egalitarian regime of total equality of the members in both work and claim on resources. This communalism extended even to child-rearing; all children on the kibbutz were raised communally in a separate “children’s house” (Shpancer 2011). Although kibbutzim remain a small share of Israel’s culture and economy, many have shifted their practices and community structure to more closely resemble Israel’s wider capitalist society. Although most remain collectivist agrarian communities, some have become for-profit enterprises (Sivak 2020). Many, but not all, modern kibbutzim have differentiated between the management of the economy on one hand and the community on the other, leading to less egalitarian wages but a commitment for caring for all members of the community (Rubinstein 2007). 

<h3>2.4.3 PERSON, COMMUNITY, AND WORLD: SUB-SAHARAN METAPHYSICS</h3>

# Community and Human Self-Realization in Sub-Saharan Thought  

The concepts of community and of human self-realization are easier to understand with a basic understanding of how traditional sub-Saharan cultures conceptualize the composition of the world at large.  

According to most traditional sub-Saharan metaphysics, the entire world is an interdependent and harmonious system. The boundaries between different kinds of living things, between mind and body, between the living and the dead, and between the natural and spirit world are all **gradations of difference** rather than absolute divides. Treating them as categorically separate—as Western metaphysics does—prevents one from understanding them as they actually are (Ramose 2003; Tangwa 2005; Wiredu 1992b).  

This sense of the world as a **harmonious unity** informs nearly every aspect of how sub-Saharan communitarianism is structured. A striking example can be seen in the way the death of a community elder is understood. Although the deceased elder is acknowledged to be biologically dead, they are understood as still present in the community, insofar as their words and character are remembered (Ikuenobe 2006; Masolo 2010; Okolo 1992; Ramose 2003).  

While their presence is felt in this way, the elder is still a person within their community. Only when their name is no longer remembered by anyone living does the elder join the category of **ancestors**, a de-individualized collective of wise and beloved persons who have gone beyond material existence (Menkiti 1984).  

Furthermore, just as the world at large is understood to be an ordered and harmonious whole, most African communitarianism likewise understand human individuals to be, themselves, each a community of many self-elements (Gbadegesin 1991; Neequaye 2020; Ogbonnaya 1994).  

This principle of organization helps underscore why **self-realization must take place in the context of a community**. Because everything that exists is by its nature part of an interconnected and interdependent whole, realizing your purpose in the world must necessarily include acknowledging that you are part of that system of interconnection.

## Sidebar: The Role of Religion in Sub-Saharan Communitarian Thought  

It is easy—but also wrong—to assume that the metaphysical outlook described above is intrinsically “religious” in a way that is not true of the prevailing metaphysical views of the contemporary West (Oladipo 2003).  

The relationship between **religion and metaphysics** is very complicated, and it is entirely possible (and very common) for a person to hold metaphysical beliefs that are rooted in a religion they don’t practice or even know very much about, because those beliefs have shaped their community and culture in ways that are not obviously religious.  

Therefore, although communitarianism is not intrinsically more “religious” than the other frameworks in this book, it is important to understand that there are some major differences between the traditional religions of Africa and the religions that have been foundational to contemporary Europe and America.  

For this reason, we are giving a brief background on sub-Saharan-African traditions—which, like the Abrahamic traditions, have vital and significant differences but nonetheless share some important assumptions about the world.  

---

### Religion in Euro-American Ethics  

In discussing the three classically Western canonical frameworks, we noted that each is compatible with a religious or theistic worldview but can also be adhered to without any belief in God or any religious commitments.  

Whereas this is true in general, it is worth noting that discussions of *“religion”* in the context of Euro-American ethics almost always mean the **Abrahamic traditions**:  

- Judaism  
- Christianity  
- Islam  

Although these three religions are not interchangeable, they share many common beliefs about both human nature and divine nature. Those shared beliefs serve as a **metaphysical baseline** for most people raised in communities where Abrahamic religions are the norm—even people who reject the religions themselves or do not believe in God.  

Indeed, they are so widespread that it can be hard to notice. But these religions differ sharply from the indigenous religions of sub-Saharan Africa.  

---

### Indigenous Traditions of Sub-Saharan Africa  

The indigenous traditions of sub-Saharan Africa begin with very different metaphysical assumptions. Two major differences stand out:  

#### 1. The Role of the Divine in Human Knowledge  
Unlike the Abrahamic religions, which are **revealed religions** (teachings given directly by God to humans), sub-Saharan African religions are **not revealed religions**.  

- Divinities and spirits exist, but they do not communicate with humans in the same way.  
- They are not a direct source of rules or teachings.  
- Instead, rules and teachings come from the community’s own wisdom and knowledge of the world, which includes spirits (Gyekye 1987).  

#### 2. The Relationship Between the Spiritual Realm and Morality  
In Abrahamic contexts, when God is understood as an enforcer, morality can become about **avoiding punishment** rather than about what is genuinely right. This tension has led many European thinkers to argue that genuine **humanism** is incompatible with religious belief.  

This problem does **not** arise in sub-Saharan African traditions:  

- The gods are **not keepers of morality**.  
- The spirit world that people enter after death is **not entirely distinct** from the living community.  
- Ancestors remain part of the human community—not as gods, but as **cherished and respected people** (Ikuenobe 2006; Wiredu 1992a).  

<h3>2.4.4 SELF-REALIZATION IN SUB-SAHARAN COMMUNITARIANISM</h3>

# Self-Realization and Personhood in Sub-Saharan Thought  

Although there are variations across traditions and communities, there are significant commonalities in the idea of **self-realization** as it is found across sub-Saharan Africa (Tangwa 2000; Wiredu 2009).  

The language used to describe the achievement of this self-realization is nearly always rendered in English as **“becoming a person.”** This conception of personhood has both:  

- a **descriptive element**: capturing the basic biological and metaphysical features intrinsic to all persons (Ikuenobe 2006).  
- a **normative element**: focusing on the realization of a person’s potential for excellence and humanity as a participant in their community (Gbadegesin 1991; Gyekye 1987; Ikuenobe 2006; Menkiti 2005; Wiredu 2009).  

Achieving and maintaining self-realization is a **long-term project**, because it involves:  
- absorbing values,  
- taking on responsibilities, and  
- upholding them throughout adulthood (Ikuenobe 2006; Menkiti 1984).  

---

## Self-Realization as a Communal Project  

Self-realization is **not** something an individual can accomplish by herself. It is:  

- **part of a community effort**,  
- **validated by recognition from the community**, and  
- shared between the individual and their community.  

The community imparts values, while the individual accepts and lives by them (Kaphagawani 2005; Menkiti 1984; Presbey 2002; Wiredu 2003).  

The achievement itself is also **shared with the community**, since the development of a person is understood as a **communal project** involving:  
- education,  
- nurture, and  
- role models (Hallen 2005; Ikuenobe 2006; Masolo 2010).  

---

## Rituals, Roles, and Responsibilities  

The achievement of self-realization is often celebrated through **rituals of training** or **induction into community knowledge** (Masolo 2010).  

Complete self-realization also involves claiming **specific social roles** (such as parent or elder), which:  
- carry social responsibilities,  
- are recognized by others, and  
- contribute to the community’s well-being.  

Importantly, these social roles are **not merely biological**. For example:  
- You are not a mother or father just because you contributed biological material to a child.  
- You are a parent because you **love, nurture, and provide** for that child (Masolo 2010).

## Sidebar: Agent-Centered vs. Patient-Centered Personhood  

As you will see in chapter 4, using the concept of **personhood** to describe a distinctively human way of being valuable is not unique to sub-Saharan Africa. Ethical thought in general almost always involves some notion of personhood, even if it is implicit (Behrens 2011).  

- The **sub-Saharan conception of personhood** is **agent-centered**.  
  - Focus: how someone can and should conduct themselves.  
  - Emphasis: upholding duties and obligations to others.  
  - The spotlight is on the **agent** who acts rightly (Molefe 2020; Tangwa 2000).  

- The **Western conception of personhood** (especially in the U.S., in bioethics and medical ethics) is usually **patient-centered**.  
  - Focus: the **rights and protections of individuals**.  
  - Emphasis: the **patient** as a holder of rights.  
  - Moral reasoning: agents must respect and protect the patient’s rights.  

Thus, while both approaches affirm the value of personhood, they differ in **whose perspective is centered**—the duty-bearing agent (sub-Saharan) or the rights-bearing patient (Western).  

<h3>2.4.5 UBUNTU</h3>

<p>Ubuntu refers to a crucial human quality that is central to communitarianism of southern and eastern Africa. (Gade 2011) The word “ubuntu” comes from a family of Bantu languages spoken in southern Africa and has close equivalents in several other languages across the southern half of the continent (Idoniboye-Obu and Whetho 2013). The word first appeared in writing in the mid-nineteenth century, but the principle has been transmitted through oral traditions for centuries, in the form of proverbs, myths, riddles and other narratives (Gade 2011; Kamwangamalu 1999). In the past several decades, ubuntu has been taken up by thinkers and politicians in South Africa and Zimbabwe, in an attempt to articulate a distinctly African political philosophy of humane justice. In this same timeframe, it has also become popular among theologians and philosophers from English-speaking countries who aspire to a more global approach to ethics. On account of these two movements, the ubuntu tradition has gained broad name recognition, but it has become increasingly ill defined the more widely it has circulated (Gade 2011; Idoniboye-Obu and Whetho 2013). 
 

Even when one focuses on indigenous sources, ubuntu is notoriously difficult to define because it is understood to encompass so many interrelated aspects and ways of being (Idoniboye-Obu and Whetho 2013; Kamwangamalu 1999). In essence, to live with ubuntu means to engage in the process of becoming and being human: to attend to and embrace the interdependence of human existence, in the broader context of an interdependent and harmonious universe. (Mkhize 2008) Ubuntu has been described not only as a quality of character but as an ethic, an orientation, a standard of judgment, and a mode of being (Gade 2011; Idoniboye-Obu and Whetho 2013; Mkhize 2008; Munkaya and Motlhabi 2009). And indeed, the claims that ubuntu makes on a person are so comprehensive that all of these descriptions are potentially useful. 
 

Because ubuntu is a human quality rather than an abstract principle, it is not enough to believe in the values of ubuntu. Rather, it requires continuous engagement with the ever-changing world around us, and particularly the active, ongoing affirmation of the humanity of those around us (Chimuka 2001). This affirmation extends not only to one’s immediate community, but also to strangers and outsiders (Munkaya and Motlhabi 2009). Because a person living in accordance with ubuntu “cannot look on the suffering of another and remain unaffected” (Mkhize 2008) in a thriving ubuntu community, all challenges are met both communally and cooperatively (Munkaya and Motlhab 2009). 
 

There are differences within different branches of the ubuntu tradition about whether or not humans have distinct metaphysical status or dignity that set them apart from other creatures (Chimuka 2001; Mkhize 2008), but the fact of being human means that has one particular obligations to other members of the human community. </p>

<h3>2.4.6 YORÙBÁ COMMUNITARIANISM</h3>

<p>Yorùbá communitarianism is a tradition based in the region of western Africa that is now Nigeria, along with neighboring parts of Togo and Benin. Although the societies in this region operated under a variety of political structures, nearly all of them were grounded in communitarianism. 
 

Yorùbá communitarianism is noteworthy because of its distinctive and well-documented epistemology (that is, its conception of knowledge.) Instead of using vision as the metaphorical basis for understanding, Yorùbá communitarianism instead takes hearing to be the foundation of how understanding works (Oyěwùmí 1997). This approach to knowledge emphasizes the relational nature of knowledge; whereas the underlying model of learning-as-seeing invites us to imagine the thing we are learning as wholly passive under our gaze, learning-as-hearing gives the thing learned about an active role in the perceiver’s learning and emphasizes the interaction and exchange between them. This epistemological approach also underscores the relational, rather than biological, nature of social roles and relationships, because an individual’s physical appearance is not taken to be a significant indicator of who they are (Oyěwùmí 1997). 
 

As a consequence of its conceptual rootedness in hearing, Yorùbá communitarianism draws a sharp distinction between firsthand knowledge, which an individual has seen and understood for herself, and all other kinds. The language used to describe second-hand knowledge—whether it is learned from a book, from tradition, or from a friend’s story over lunch—is best translated as “agreeing to what one hears” (Hallen and Sodipo 1997). 
 

While this conceptualization of knowledge might at first sound radically individualist, it in fact underscores the extent to which community members depend on one another to know and to understand. Furthermore, it calls attention to the importance of relationships in shaping how information and knowledge is exchanged: an individual who is known to be conscientious and trustworthy will have a greater voice in shaping the community’s shared understanding of a situation. For these reasons, being an observant witness to one’s own experiences, being reliably thoughtful and measured in understanding those experiences, and being careful and precise in communicating them to others are all important elements of a good character in Yorùbá communitarianism (Hallen 2005). </p>

<h3>.4.7 IS THE COMMUNITY AN INTRINSIC GOOD OR AN INSTRUMENTAL ONE?</h3>

<p>There is no question that community is essential to achieving personhood in sub-Saharan ethics. Simply put, there is no way to achieve self-realization apart from a community. What is sometimes less clear, however, is the exact role that communities play in securing an individual’s self-realization, philosophically speaking. Is the community an end in itself, the necessary basis of self-realization? Or is it a means to an end, a necessary path rather than a destination? (Metz 2011). 
 

Earlier studies of sub-Saharan communitarianism—perhaps aimed at drawing the sharpest possible contrast with western liberal individualism (Oyowe 2013)—all agreed that community was the center of sub-Saharan value systems and that the value of the individual person is fundamentally constituted by the community and conferred upon them by community recognition (Menkiti 1984). In recent years, however, many scholars have argued that, while individuals need community in order to achieve well-being and self-realization, the true goal of sub-Saharan communitarianism is to create good for all of the individuals in it. </p>

<h3>2.4.8 MODALITIES FOR JUDGMENT</h3>

<p>Sub-Saharan communitarianism is not unique in understanding ethics to be about how to live well with others. But the communitarian framework is distinctive in the way that it positions us to understand individuals and their development in terms of their communities. This distinctive community focus is reflected in its modalities for judgment, which can be formulated as a series of principles that are relational and community-oriented, grounded in the authority of shared humanity and in the reality of our social nature. This principle-based form of ethical reasoning bears some similarity to deontology (recall in particular that deontology centers on duties to others.) But the community-oriented, relational aspect of communitarianism contrasts with an orientation, for many deontological theories, toward an autonomous rational subject.</p>

The Consensus Principle

<p>The Consensus Principle
The principle of consensus urges us to find common ground with others who have a stake in a given issue. This principle is rooted in both the knowledge theory and the social organization of communitarianism. As we saw above in the Yorùbá tradition specifically, communitarianism considers the tasks of knowing and understanding to be cooperative by necessity. Similarly, Edward Wamala writes of one of the Bantu kingdoms in Uganda, “Nobody has a monopoly on knowledge; everybody is in need of the knowledge and opinions of others” (Wamala 2005, 438). Because communitarianism presumes a strong model of collective participation, it becomes possible to overcome the limits of our individual knowledge by working together to understand and decide. 
 

It should be noted that this principle does not assume uniformity of opinion. In fact, it assumes the opposite—if everyone agreed, there would be no need for further discussion. Furthermore, the principle of consensus does not require a community member to surrender to the will of the group. Rather, it demands that each community member participate in the group’s deliberations. 
 

Although this principle might at first strike you as irrelevant to at least some kinds of ethical quandaries, further reflection from within the communitarian framework will likely reveal that many problems that seem at first to be yours alone can, in fact, be understood as shared with others in your life—even if it’s only because of their relationship with you. </p>

The Principle of Building Community

<p>This principle directs us to nurture a sense of common cause and belonging with others in our community. Because people exist in a state of mutual dependence, we all benefit when those necessary ties are strengthened by feelings of solidarity, trust, and belonging. In other words, it is easier to be happy about helping others and to set aside your personal desires in order to help another if you feel a sense of shared identity or community with those others and if you trust that they will help you. 
 

Honoring this principle can be as simple as making time for conversation with others. It can also require more significant acts of mutual aid. It can even be helpful to create new structures of mutual dependence, such as a study group, to help strengthen your own and others’ commitment to helping and being helped by others (Masolo 2010). </p>

The Principle of Peace/Rehabilitation
<p>According to this principle, an individual should always try, within reasonable measure, to repair relationships with others (Mangena 2015). This principle grows from the understanding that self-realization requires that one have good relationships whenever possible. Maintaining good relationships with others is, therefore, partly an act of self-interest—but characteristically so for communitarianism, because pursuing one’s own interest aligns with the good of the whole. 
 

A further dimension of this principle is the importance of restorative justice, a form of justice that centers on making restitution to victims rather than punishing wrongdoers. This principle depends on the cooperation of everyone involved, including the willing participation of those harmed, and often involves other community members as advisors and mediators (Mangena 2015). Honoring this principle means making an effort to rehabilitate wrongdoers, whenever it can be done without being unjust to those who have been wronged. This principle leaves open the possibility of cutting ties with a relentless wrongdoer; good relationships, after all, must be mutual. But insofar as it is possible for an individual to better themself and the other individual by remaining connected, one should seek to do so (Molefe 2020; Wiredu 2009). </p>
