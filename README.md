/*One of the features of computing technologies that Moor argued makes them unique is what he called the “invisibility factor.”

 * Think for instance of the numerous computer chips and programs running silently in your car or on your smartphone.
 
 * Moor targeted three issues that stem from the invisibility factor:
 
 * (1) the malicious invisible abuse of the lower-level operations of a computer to invisibly exploit the user who is, for example, transferring money;
 
 * (2) the invisible programming values present in any decision-making algorithm that may ensure that different
 
 * people are invisibly advantaged or disadvantaged by the use of that algorithm;
 * (3) the largely unchallenged assumption that computers
 
 * perform invisible complex calculations that no human is able to inspect and understand completely.
 
 * We pick up many of these themes of invisibility throughout the book. */

/*Technology and society scholar Deborah Johnson (1998) 
 
 * has argued that three specific changes have been brought about by the broader societal reconfigurations stemming from computer technologies:

###Reproducibility:###

Computing, information, and communication technology has radically changed the rate at which texts, images, video,

and other kinds of information can be reproduced or transmitted to others. It has also made it much easier to collect,

link, and preserve records. These developments have impacts in many areas of both privacy and society at large,


and we explore them extensively in chapters 4 and 5.

###Information flow:###

Whereas earlier advances in communication technology have mostly improved the speed

or effectiveness of one-to-one or one-to-many communication, the internet and other computing technologies

have made it much easier to engage in many-to-many communication and for individuals to engage as the one in a one-to-many setup.

These changes have had impacts in many areas of society on how we share knowledge and information;

we explore these themes in chapters 3 and 5.

##Identity conditions:###

Our experiences as individuals in society are affected by advances in connectivity and computation because they

enhance our ability to communicate with others; increase the likelihood that we are

identified, recorded, and logged as we go about our daily lives; and, crucially, enable us to communicate via anonymous mechanisms.

Developments in computing technology have made it easier to speak and act without any visible ties of these words or actions

to their legal names or their public reputations, and they also have made it easier to track and identify individuals in many areas

ETHICAL FRAMEWORKS


Learning Objectives
At the end of this chapter you will be able to:

1.  Explain why multiple frameworks have developed for understanding the world instead of one unified theory.

2.  Describe the key points of ethical frameworks including deontology, utilitarianism, virtue ethics, and communitarianism.

3.  Contrast the traditions described within each of the four frameworks and articulate

    how these different developments within the frameworks enable a wider breadth of application.

4.  Use the contemporary frameworks of responsibility ethics, feminist ethics, and the capabilities approach to critique the classical frameworks.

5.  Formulate the key ethical tensions within a story by drawing on the conceptual resources of the ethical frameworks.
