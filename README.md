## Ethics Fundamentals

### What is Ethics?

| Aspect               | Description                                                                                   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Definition           | A code of behavior defined by a group or society.                                             |
| Purpose              | Enables organized living, mutual benefit, and resource access.                                |
| Flexibility          | Norms may change over time to meet evolving societal needs.                                   |
| Example              | Security, roles, responsibilities, access to resources.                                       |

|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Definition           | Personal principles guiding decisions about right and wrong.                                  |

**Case Example:**  
- **Software Piracy:**  
  - Definition: Making unauthorized copies or providing access to software.
  - Global Rate: ~42% (80% in some regions, e.g., Africa)

## Integrity in Practice

- Acting with integrity means aligning actions with personal principles.
- Consistency is key; moral standards should not change based on situation or parties involved.
- Dilemmas arise when personal morals conflict with professional ethics or legal requirements.

**Example Dilemmas:**
- Lawyers defending guilty clients due to professional ethics.
- Doctors restricted by medical ethics from euthanasia, despite personal beliefs.

---

## Key Questions for Consideration

1. What is ethics?
2. What trends have increased the likelihood of unethical behavior?
3. What is corporate social responsibility, and why is fostering good business ethics important?
4. What measures can organizations take to improve their business ethics?
5. How can you include ethical considerations in your decision making?
6. What trends have increased the risk that information technology will be used in an unethical manner?

---

## Critical Thinking Exercise

**Legal vs. Ethical Actions:**  
Consider examples for each quadrant (see table above) and reflect on situations where legality and morality may conflict.

# Ethics of Computing and Technology  
*Engaging Through Science Fiction*  
*The MIT Press, 2023*

## 1. Ethical Statements: Normative vs. Descriptive

Ethics is often misunderstood as being only **normative**—focused on what should be. In reality, even simple factual descriptions often embed subtle value judgments.

- **Normative Statements**: Assess how things *should* be.
  - Examples:
      - “He was wrong to do that.”
      - “Being kind is more important than being the most successful.”
  - Rooted in judgments about good/bad, permissible/forbidden, and the relative value of things.

- **Descriptive Statements**: Assess how things *are*.
  - Example:
      - A newspaper’s choice of “suspect,” “loiterer,” “passerby,” “boy,” or “juvenile” to describe a person arrested near a crime scene.  
        Each term meets factual criteria but communicates different normative judgments, shaping public perception.

**Key Point:** Every act of description involves choices, often unconsciously, that communicate values.

---

## 2. Ethics and Computing: The Invisibility Factor

James Moor identified the "invisibility factor" as a unique ethical challenge in computing:

1. **Invisible Abuse**: Exploitation through hidden or lower-level computer operations (e.g., silent manipulation during financial transactions).
2. **Invisible Programming Values**: Algorithms make decisions that advantage or disadvantage people in ways users cannot see.
3. **Invisible Calculations**: Computers perform complex calculations beyond human inspection or understanding.

**Reflection:**  
Always ask, “What is invisible in this technology? What values are embedded in the unseen?”

---

## 3. Technology’s Impact on Society (Deborah Johnson)

Deborah Johnson (1998) highlights three major societal changes due to computing technologies:

### a) Reproducibility
- Rapid, mass reproduction and transmission of information (texts, images, videos).
- Easier collection, linking, and preservation of records.
- Significant implications for privacy and record-keeping.

### b) Information Flow
- Shift from one-to-one and one-to-many communication to many-to-many (e.g., social media).
- Changes how knowledge is shared and accessed.

### c) Identity Conditions
- Increased connectivity and computation enhance both tracking and anonymity.
- Technology enables anonymous communication and action, but also facilitates pervasive surveillance.

---

## 4. Science Fiction: A Tool for Ethical Engagement

Science fiction immerses us in alternative sociotechnical worlds, helping us consider how societies and individuals adapt to and are shaped by new technologies.

**Application:**  
Analyze sci-fi scenarios to anticipate real-world ethical challenges.

---

## 5. Ethical Frameworks (Chapter 2, Page 45+)

### Learning Objectives
- Understand why multiple ethical frameworks exist.
- Identify and describe the key frameworks: **deontology**, **utilitarianism**, **virtue ethics**, and **communitarianism**.
- Contrast the traditions and applications of each framework.
- Critique classical frameworks using contemporary approaches (e.g., responsibility ethics, feminist ethics, capabilities approach).
- Formulate and analyze ethical tensions within stories and cases.

---

### Overview of Ethical Frameworks

#### **Deontology**
- **Focus:** Duties, rights, and moral obligations.
- **Principle:** Rightness/wrongness is determined by adherence to rules, not outcomes.
- **Divine Command Theory:** Morality based on obedience to God’s commands (Euthyphro problem: Are things good because God commands them, or does God command them because they are good?).

#### **Virtue Ethics**
- **Focus:** Human flourishing and character.
- **Principle:** Virtues are means between extremes (Aristotle’s "golden mean").
- **Examples:**  
    | Virtue      | Excess            | Deficiency             |
    |-------------|-------------------|------------------------|
    | Courage     | Recklessness      | Cowardice              |
    | Friendliness| Flattery/Fawning  | Hostility/Crankiness   |
    | Temperance  | Overindulgence    | Insensitivity          |
    | Generosity  | Wastefulness      | Stinginess             |
  - The suitable degree of virtue varies by situation and is guided by practical wisdom.

#### **Communitarianism**
- **Focus:** Interdependence, common good, self-realization within community.
- **Principle:** Social, spiritual, and psychological goods arise from relationships; isolation hinders self-realization.

#### **Utilitarianism**
- **Focus:** Happiness and outcomes.
- **Principle:** The greatest happiness for the greatest number; actions are judged by their overall effects.

---

## 6. Modalities for Judgment

- Ethical frameworks serve as lenses, not explicit formulas.
- Multiple frameworks may reach similar conclusions by different reasoning.
- Strong frameworks remain flexible for diverse contexts and challenges.

---

## 7. Key Takeaways

- Technology ethics requires consideration of both visible and invisible impacts.
- Ethical reasoning is a process—contextual, comparative, and often quantitative.
- Applied ethics asks: “How does this affect real people, now and in the future?”

---

## 8. Critical Questions for Practice

1. What invisible values or biases are embedded in the algorithms you use?
2. How does reproducibility challenge traditional privacy?
3. How do tech communities promote or hinder self-realization and collective well-being?
4. How can happiness or harm from technology be measured, and who decides the metrics?
5. Where do your own value judgments influence your technology assessments?
