# Ethics of Technology – Semantic and Applied Notes

## 1. Foundational Concepts

### Ethics in Technology
- Ethics is often misunderstood as only **normative** (what should be), but every description, even factual, contains **normative judgments**.
- Example: The choice of words in a newspaper (“suspect” vs. “passerby”) shapes public perception and conveys implicit value judgments.

#### Normative vs. Descriptive
- **Normative**: Assessment of how things should be.  
  - e.g., “He was wrong to do that.”
  - e.g., “Being kind is more important than being the most successful.”
- **Descriptive**: Statements about how things are.
- **Interpolation**: Even “objective” descriptions embed normative choices; language always carries values.

## 2. Unique Ethical Challenges of Computing

### Moor’s “Invisibility Factor”
1. **Invisible Abuse**: Hidden exploitation (e.g., through lower-level computer operations).
2. **Invisible Programming Values**: Algorithms invisibly advantage/disadvantage different people.
3. **Invisible Calculations**: Complexity prevents human inspection/understanding.

**Applied Note:**  
When evaluating technology, always ask: “What is invisible to the user or society? What values are embedded in the unseen?”  
*Quantitative Angle*: Estimate percentage of users affected by invisible biases (e.g., algorithmic bias in recruiting, facial recognition accuracy differences).

## 3. Technology’s Impact on Society (Deborah Johnson’s Framework)

### 3.1 Reproducibility
- Rapid, easy duplication and transmission of information (texts, images, video).
- Impacts privacy and record-keeping.
- *Applied*: Compare historical rates of information spread (pre/post-internet).

### 3.2 Information Flow
- Shift from one-to-one to many-to-many communication (e.g., social media platforms).
- *Applied*: Measure growth of network connections per user over time.

### 3.3 Identity Conditions
- Enhanced connectivity increases tracking and anonymity.
- *Applied*: Analyze number of anonymous interactions vs. identified ones online.

**Interpolation:**  
Each development increases the ethical complexity: more data means more potential for misuse, but also for positive connection.

## 4. Why Use Science Fiction?
- Sci-fi scenarios help explore how societies adapt to and are shaped by technology.
- *Applied*: Use case studies from sci-fi stories to model potential real-world outcomes.

## 5. Ethical Frameworks (Chapter 2, pg 45+)

### Learning Objectives
1. Multiple frameworks exist due to complex, conflicting human values.
2. Key frameworks: **deontology**, **utilitarianism**, **virtue ethics**, **communitarianism**.
3. Contrast and apply frameworks to real-world stories.
4. Critique classical frameworks using contemporary approaches (responsibility ethics, feminist ethics, capabilities approach).
5. Identify and formulate ethical tensions in stories.

### 5.1 Frameworks Overview

#### **Deontology**
- Focuses on duties, rights, moral obligations.
- Principles (laws, rules, maxims) guide actions regardless of outcome.
- **Divine Command Theory**: Authority from God; obey because God commands.
  - *Euthyphro Problem*: Is something good because God commands it, or does God command it because it’s good?
- *Applied*: What rules must be followed even if outcomes seem undesirable?  
  - E.g., Data privacy laws: Should companies honor privacy even if sharing data benefits many?

#### **Virtue Ethics**
- Centers on moral character and human flourishing.
- **Aristotelian Mean**: Virtue is the midpoint between two vices (e.g., courage between recklessness and cowardice).
- *Applied*: How does a tech leader’s character influence ethical company culture?  
  - Quantify: Number of virtue-based policies adopted by tech organizations.

#### **Communitarianism**
- Focuses on interdependence and common good.
- Self-realization is possible only within a community of shared values.
- *Applied*: How do collaborative tech platforms (open source) foster community well-being?
  - Quantify: Number of contributors, frequency of collaboration, collective benefits.

#### **Utilitarianism**
- Prioritizes greatest happiness for the greatest number; outcome-based.
- *Applied*: Calculate net benefits vs. harms from a technology (e.g., social media’s impact on mental health).

### Modalities for Judgment
- Each framework is a lens, not a formula—flexibility is key.
- Two frameworks might reach the same conclusion but by different reasoning.

## 6. Sidebar: Aristotelian Virtues Table

| Virtue      | Excess            | Deficiency            | Golden Mean Principle                      |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Courage     | Recklessness      | Cowardice             | Suitability varies by situation            |
| Friendliness| Flattery/Fawning  | Crankiness            | Guided by practical wisdom                 |
| Temperance  | Overindulgence    | Lack of appreciation  | Not a fixed midpoint, needs judgment       |
| Generosity  | Careless spending | Stinginess            | Context-dependent                          |

## 7. Key Interpolations

- Every ethical evaluation in technology must consider both visible and invisible impacts.
- Frameworks are tools: use them comparatively and contextually.
- Quantitative analysis (e.g., user surveys, data studies) can reveal scale of ethical impact.
- Applied ethics asks: “How does this affect real people, now and in the future?”

## 8. Applied Questions for Further Study

1. What invisible values are embedded in the algorithms you use?
2. How does information reproducibility challenge traditional notions of privacy?
3. In what ways do tech communities foster (or hinder) self-realization and mutual well-being?
4. How can we measure the happiness or harm produced by a technology, and who decides what counts?
5. Where do your own value judgments shape your description or evaluation of a tech issue?
