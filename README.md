/*Technology and society scholar Deborah Johnson (1998) 
 
 * has argued that three specific changes have been brought about by the broader societal reconfigurations stemming from computer technologies:

###Reproducibility:###

Computing, information, and communication technology has radically changed the rate at which texts, images, video,

and other kinds of information can be reproduced or transmitted to others. It has also made it much easier to collect,

link, and preserve records. These developments have impacts in many areas of both privacy and society at large,


and we explore them extensively in chapters 4 and 5.

###Information flow:###

Whereas earlier advances in communication technology have mostly improved the speed

or effectiveness of one-to-one or one-to-many communication, the internet and other computing technologies

have made it much easier to engage in many-to-many communication and for individuals to engage as the one in a one-to-many setup.

These changes have had impacts in many areas of society on how we share knowledge and information;

we explore these themes in chapters 3 and 5.

##Identity conditions:###

Our experiences as individuals in society are affected by advances in connectivity and computation because they

enhance our ability to communicate with others; increase the likelihood that we are

identified, recorded, and logged as we go about our daily lives; and, crucially, enable us to communicate via anonymous mechanisms.

Developments in computing technology have made it easier to speak and act without any visible ties of these words or actions

to their legal names or their public reputations, and they also have made it easier to track and identify individuals in many areas

ETHICAL FRAMEWORKS


Learning Objectives
At the end of this chapter you will be able to:

1.  Explain why multiple frameworks have developed for understanding the world instead of one unified theory.

2.  Describe the key points of ethical frameworks including deontology, utilitarianism, virtue ethics, and communitarianism.

3.  Contrast the traditions described within each of the four frameworks and articulate

    how these different developments within the frameworks enable a wider breadth of application.

4.  Use the contemporary frameworks of responsibility ethics, feminist ethics, and the capabilities approach to critique the classical frameworks.

5.  Formulate the key ethical tensions within a story by drawing on the conceptual resources of the ethical frameworks.
===
2.1.1 MULTIPLE FRAMEWORKS
frameworks in this chapter are 
deontology,
virtue,
ethics,
communitarianism,
utilitarianism,
===
Each of the four frameworks offers a different orientation toward the task of ethics.
Stated briefly, deontology emphasizes moral obligation and prescribes or describes moral principles that govern action.
===
Virtue ethics centers on human character as the locus of moral activity and pays special attention to how we develop and exercise good qualities.
===
Communitarianism focuses on the interdependent nature of human life and examines how that interdependence shapes our possibilities for well-being and self-realization.
===
Utilitarianism prioritizes the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people and therefore focuses on the outcomes of actions.
===
Under each framework you will also find a section called “Modalities for Judgment.”
===
These sections describe the patterns of thought and methods that characterize each framework.
===
Ethical theories—and more broadly, ethical frameworks—operate with the presupposition that human life is complicated and that conflicts will be inevitable
===
We use the term “modality” to indicate that all ethical frameworks provide an orientation for determining which kinds of actions are ethical and which are not.
-
A strong ethical framework is one that is flexible enough to address a wide range of ethical problems and can be mobilized in a variety of contexts.
===
It is important to see that the process of describing and reasoning through ethical problems can and should be distinguished from the conclusions that you reach.
-
Just as a single ethical framework can admit many different and even conflicting judgments about the same problem, it is possible for two different frameworks to come to the same conclusion about what should be done.
-
Similarly, two people using two different ethical frameworks might arrive at similar conclusions.
-
These modalities for judgment are not explicit formulas or algorithms.
--
We invite you to see them instead as lenses to evaluate the challenging problems that come with developments in technology.
===
Even within deontology—an ethical framework that is known to emphasize laws and rules—things are never this easy.
-
Human life is much more complex, and the task of ethics is for each of us to live the best life that we can.
-
That task is complicated and challenging enough that most people decide, after some reflection, that they will take all the help they can get.
===
2.2 DEONTOLOGY
Deontology as an approach to ethics is best characterized by its focus on duties, rights, and moral obligations.
-
Its two main presuppositions are that ethical evaluation primarily concerns the rightness or wrongness of actions and that ethical reasoning should help determine what we ought 
===
The word “deontology” comes from the Greek word deon, meaning duty, obligation, or “that which is binding,” and -ology, indicating a particular branch of knowledge.
-
Deontology has existed in various forms. One of the most famous is associated with the eighteenth-century German philosopher Immanuel Kant.
===
Most notably, deontology emphasizes the rightness or wrongness of an action by reference to certain action-guiding principles.
-
Depending on the context, these principles can be described as laws, rules, maxims, imperatives, or commands.
-
Whatever the terms used, these principles are said to place certain constraints on human action.
-
These constraints apply—or at the very least must be seriously considered—even in situations in which the consequences of an action are understood to be desirable or good.===
The second misunderstanding is that because it is difficult to honor one’s many duties at the same time,
-
you can therefore pick and choose which laws to follow as a matter of individual choice or preference (or perhaps a matter of avoiding the least desirable punishments).
-
But simply acting on preferences and regarding those preferences as if they are binding laws is not an accurate description of deontology.
-
In fact, this kind of picking and choosing has more in common with moral relativism than it does with any of the ethical frameworks that we discuss in this chapter.

"Hobbes insisted that humans are driven solely by their own self-interest

but because they are too fragile and weak to live on their own,

it is necessary to be part of a society

in which individuals sacrificesome of their freedom

and agree to be governed by a sovereign authority

in which disputes and self-interest can be mitigated appropriately"

Divine command theory

is one form of deontology that derives its authority from God. Broadly speaking,

divine command theory holds that moral obligations consist of obedience to God.

Under divine command theory, an action is obligatory because God or the gods command it

and it is impermissible if God or gods forbid it.

If that action is neither obligatory nor forbidden,

it is considered to be a permissible action

===

Although the notion of god-given laws is conceptually straightforward,

there is an interesting philosophical problem at their core:
did god(s) give this law because it is right,
    
or is the law right because it comes from god(s)?
    
This is sometimes referred to as the Euthyphro problem,
    
referring to a dialogue written by Plato in which Socrates asks,
    
“Is the pious loved by the gods because it is pious,
    
or is it pious because it is loved by the gods? ” (Plato, Euthyphro 10a1–3).
    
Most divine command traditions do not have a settled answer to this question,
    
and it is a topic of ongoing philosophical and religious debate.

Virtue Ethics

is an approach to ethics organized around the idea of

human flourishing and human excellence.

Its basic assumption is that all human beings share some basic qualities of character,

though we vary widely in how much we excel at those qualities and how we express them,

and each of us gets better (or worse) at them according to our experiences.

It further assumes that human beings

are concerned with how to live the good life

and that ethics is a subset of what it means to live a full and happy life.
=====================================================
Sidebar: Aristotelian Virtues as a Mean between Vices

In the Nicomachean Ethics,

Aristotle describes the moral virtues as existing at an intermediate point

between two extremes of vice.

(Aristotle 2.8) The following table lays out some of the moral virtues

described in the Nicomachean Ethics, along with the vices that represent an excessive

or deficient exercise of that same quality.

Presenting them grouped together in this way should make clearer what “finding the mean” looks like in practice.

This virtue is the midpoint
1 courage
2 friendliness
3 temperance
4 generosity
---
between this excess
1 recklessness
2 flattery and fawning
3 overindulgence
4 carless overspending
---
and this deficiency
1 cowardice
2 crankiness
3 lack of apperciation for pleasures
4 stinginess
---

It’s worth noting that the precisely suitable degree of exercising a given virtue

(known in the Aristotelian tradition as the golden mean)

will not be the mathematical center point between the two extremes

and will vary from situation to situation.

For this reason, one’s exercise of virtue needs to be guided by practical wisdom.

2.4 COMMUNITARIANISM

Communitarianism is an approach to ethics organized around self-realization in the context of interdependence.

Its basic assumption is that human beings exist in a state of mutual reliance on one anot
her (Masolo 2010; Smith-Morris 2020).

Although this interdependence includes material goods like shelter and safety,

the more significant dimension of our interdependence concerns the many social,

spiritual, and psychological goods that can only come from relationships with others.

Because we are interdependent, everybody benefits from investing in the common good,

or the well-being of the community as a whole (Masolo 2010; Wiredu 1992a).

---
But according to the baseline premises of communitarianism,

any person who lives in isolation

from a community of shared values and ideals—“an abstract dangling personality,”

to use Polycarp Ikuenobe’s striking phrase—will not be able to achieve self-realization (Ikuenobe 2006).

==
pg 94
==
UTILITARIANISM

is an approach to ethics organized around the idea of happiness.

Like virtue ethics, utilitarianism is an outcome-based approach to ethics

that assumes that human beings are motivated by the desire to be happy.

Building on the basic assumption that humans are motivated by happiness,

utilitarians argue that when it comes to determining how we should act,

we should first and foremost consider

what kinds of actions bring about the most happiness for the greatest number of people.

This is known as the principle of utility
